Over a 3-month period, a detection dog located multiple (n = 11, 4 confirmed and 7 potential) bush dog areas in Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest of Misiones Argentina. These positive results demonstrate that detection dogs can provide species-specific data on the bush dog despite the rugged terrain and dense forest vegetation they may occupy.

However, little is known about the identity of nest predators in much of the world, including the Neotropics. To identify some of the nest predators exerting selection pressure on birds of the subtropical Atlantic forest, we present observations of animals depredating bird nests in Argentina and Paraguay. We recorded depredations (destruction or removal of eggs or nestlings) at 33 nests of 25 species of birds, confirming as predators ten species of birds (Squirrel Cuckoo Piaya cayana, White-eared Puffbird Nystalus chacuru, Toco Toucan Ramphastos toco, Red-breasted Toucan Ramphastos dicolorus, Saffron Toucanet Pteroglossus baillonii, Chestnut-eared Aracari Pteroglossus castanotis, Planalto Woodcreeper Dendrocolaptes platyrostris, White-throated Woodcreeper Xiphocolaptes albicollis, Buff-browed Foliage-gleaner Syndactyla rufosuperciliata, and Plush-crested Jay Cyanocorax chrysops) and two species of medium-sized mammals (White-eared Opossum Didelphis albiventris and Crab-eating Fox Cerdocyon thous), and inferring two additional mammal species (Black Capuchin Monkey Sapajus nigritus and Southern Tigrina Leopardus guttulus). Fifty-five percent of these nests were depredated by toucans or aracaris (Ramphastidae), which destroyed eggs and nestlings at cup-, closed- and cavity-nests. Red-breasted Toucans destroyed nests 1.6–22 m high, in habitats ranging from primary forest to a backyard. Mammals and jays depredated nests from ground-level to midstory, whereas woodcreepers and aracaris depredated nests from the midstory to canopy. We did not record snakes at any bird nests, in strong contrast to studies from other Neotropical forests. Further studies should examine trade-offs among nest concealment, physical protection, and parental defense behavior as means of reducing nest predation, and use camera traps to quantify nest predation rates by predator species.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Few researchers have investigated the synergistic effects of tropical forest fragmentation and disturbance on species persistence and abundance. We examined effects of both forest-patch metrics and forest disturbance in determining richness and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammal species in a highly fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. Twenty-one forest fragments, ranging from 2 to 14,480 ha, and two continuous forest sites were sampled based on sightings, tracks, line-transect censuses, armadillo burrow censuses, and camera trapping. Patch occupancy of 37 species recorded ranged from 4\% to all forest sites surveyed. Forest fragment size was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining 90\% of the variation in species richness. Information-theoretic analysis confirmed that fragment area was the most important explanatory variable for the overall species richness and abundance of mammal species, followed by surface fires, which affected the abundance of seven species. Large mammal species were typically absent from fragments {\textless}100 ha, whereas some ubiquitous species were favored by fragmentation, exhibiting hyperabundance in small patches. Our findings highlight the importance of large ({\textgreater}10,000 ha), relatively undisturbed forest patches to maximize persistence and maintain baseline abundances of Neotropical forest mammal species.},

The dataset comprises 170 surveys of medium to large terrestrial mammals using camera traps conducted in 144 areas by 74 studies, covering six vegetation types of tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of South America (Brazil and Argentina), and present data on species composition and richness. The complete dataset comprises 53,438 independent records of 83 species of mammals, includes 10 species of marsupials, 15 rodents, 20 carnivores, eight ungulates and six armadillos. Species richness averaged 13 species (±6.07 SD) per site. Only six species occurred in more than 50\% of the sites: the domestic dog Canis familiaris, crab-eating fox Cerdocyon thous, tayra Eira barbara, south American coati Nasua nasua, crab-eating raccoon Procyon cancrivorus and the nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus. The information contained in this dataset can be used to understand macroecological patterns of biodiversity, community, and population structure, but also to evaluate the ecological consequences of fragmentation, defaunation, and trophic interactions.},

This work presents a method for recognizing mammal genera from camera-trap images. Our method uses Multi-Layer Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) for segmenting, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting features, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for selecting features, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying mammal genera present in the Colombian forest. Our classification method mixes the features of several CNNs. We evaluated our method with the camera-trap images from the Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt. We obtained an accuracy of 92.65\% classifying 8 mammal genera and a False Positive (FP) class, using automatic-segmented images. On the other hand, we reached 90.32\% of accuracy classifying 10 mammal genera, using ground-truth images only. Unlike all previous works, we confront the animal segmentation and genera classification on the camera-trap framework. This method shows a new approach toward a fully-automatic detection of animals from camera-trap images.},

	abstract = {The study of nocturnal mammals relies on indirect evidence or invasive methods involving capture and tagging of individuals. Indirect methods are prone to error, while capture and tagging mammals have logistical and ethical considerations. Off-the-shelf camera traps are perceived as an accessible, non-intrusive method for direct data gathering, having many benefits but also potential biases. Here, using a 6-year camera-trap study of a Eurasian otter holt (den), we evaluate key parameters of study design. First, we analyse patterns of holt use in relation to researcher visits to maintain the camera traps. Then, using a dual camera-trap deployment, we compare the success of data capture from each camera-trap position in relation to the dual setup. Finally, we provide analyses to optimise minimum survey effort and camera-trap programming. Our findings indicate that otter presence and resting patterns were unaffected by the researcher visits. Results were significantly better using a close camera-trap emplacement than a distant. There was a higher frequency of otter activity at the holt during the natal and early rearing period which has implications for determining the minimum survey duration. Reducing video clip duration from 30 to 19 s would have included 95\% of instances where sex could be identified, and saved 35–40\% of memory storage. Peaks of otter activity were related to sunrise and sunset; exclusion of diurnal hours would have missed 11\% of registrations. Camera-trap studies would benefit by adopting a similar framework of analyses in the preliminary stages or during a trial period to inform subsequent methodological refinements.},

Here, we investigated the temporal ecology of mesocarnivores which co-occur in a semiarid area where top predators are virtually absent. More specifically, we (i) describe the daily activity patterns of six mesocarnivore species, (ii) evaluate possible seasonal changes in their daily activity patterns, (iii) examine patterns of temporal overlap among mesocarnivores, and (iv) test the overlap in daily activity between mesocarnivores and their potential prey. Using camera-trapping data (13,976 camera-days) and circular and overlapping analyses, we studied six out of the seven mesocarnivore species recorded. Striped hog-nosed skunk and the crab-eating raccoon were nocturnal, crab-eating fox and northern tiger cat were nocturnal-crepuscular, ocelot was mainly nocturnal, and jaguarundi was diurnal. With the exception of jaguarundi, we fail to find strong temporal segregation among mesocarnivore and interspecific interactions did not vary seasonally, but we observed separation in their activity peaks and significant difference in their activity distributions. This partial temporal segregation can potentially contribute to interspecific coexistence, reducing the chances of interspecific killing, mainly in relation to the dominant species (ocelot). Mesocarnivores did not exhibit a significant synchrony of their activity with any of the preys evaluated, with the exception of jaguarundi, which significantly overlapped its distribution of activity with some preys. Temporal segregation contributes, but does not seem to be the only mechanism behind the coexistence of mesocarnivores in Caatinga dry forest; thus, other strategies such as spatial and dietary segregation should be considered.},

While most common sampling methods include live trapping (LT) and pitfall trapping (PT), camera trapping (CT) is potentially a useful technique. Studies assessing data acquisition efficiency for neotropical small mammals are mostly limited to LT and PT, and no small mammal study to date included CT. We provide a comparative assessment of the efficiency of LT (Sherman and wire-mesh traps), PT and CT in surveying small mammal species across 25 sites in an Amazonian archipelagic landscape. Based on 26,184 trap nights, we obtained 782 small mammal records representing at least 18 species. Most species were detected by both LT (72.2\%) and PT (83.3\%), but each of these methods exclusively recorded additional species, whereas CT detected only nearly one-fourth (N = 4) of all species recorded. Nevertheless, for nearly all species detected by CT, the probability of detecting individual species was similar or higher than that of LT. Species detected by CT represented the largest-bodied rodents and marsupials ({\textgreater} 200 g). Pitfall traps are an important complement to LT, and CT comprises an efficient technique to sample large-bodied small mammals. Improvements in the efficiency of camera traps in recording and identifying small-bodied species are both needed and possible, but we recommend the combination of LT and PT methods to enhance the completeness of community-wide small mammal sampling in neotropical forests.},

In this study, we examined a carnivore guild in the Pantanal wetland of Brazil to determine whether temporal niche partitioning was a mechanism for coexistence, and if this differed between the wet and dry season. We used camera trapping data to fit kernel density functions of time observations for five species of carnivores to determine activity patterns. We calculated the coefficient of overlap between all species-pair’s activity patterns. Our results found support for temporal segregation among this carnivore guild, with stronger segregation evident during the dry season. Jaguars and pumas showed large overlap in activity in both seasons, while all three mesocarnivores (ocelot, tayra, and crab-eating fox) showed temporal avoidance toward pumas. Mesocarnivores displayed segregating temporal patterns between pairs in both seasons. Temporal segregation is a mechanism for coexistence within this carnivore guild, suggesting increased competition between species especially during the dry season. To maintain carnivore populations, a broader knowledge of interspecific interactions and how this may affect species, utilization or avoidance of habitats is needed. Given the complexities of interspecific interactions among carnivores, conservation efforts should address the needs of the entire guild rather than focus on a single species.},

	abstract = {Human activities are changing ecosystems and their trophic structures across the globe and tropical forests are one of the main affected. Large carnivores can have a key role in the maintenance of biodiversity through direct and indirect effects at lower trophic levels, which are the result of predation and competition. In this sense, it is expected that changes in abundance of large predators driven by humans will affect the abundance of smaller carnivores. We explore the effects of varying degree of human intervention on the structure of a felid community of five sympatric species in Ecuador’s Amazon region. We used camera traps to survey carnivore populations in seven different areas between 2007 and 2016 and estimated density with spatial explicit capture–recapture models. The density of margays, jaguarundis, ocelots and jaguars showed a positive relationship with the conservation status of study sites, while no significant relationship was observed for pumas. We found that the anthropogenic impacts had asymmetric effects on the density of the different taxa. Jaguar and margays, the species with more stringent ecological requirements, presented higher reductions on density. Our findings support of the mesopredator release hypothesis in this tropical ecosystem. Maximum densities of pumas were detected in areas of low jaguar density, while there was a negative relationship between density of pumas and margays, jaguarundis, and ocelots. Our results show how human disturbance can have important ecological effects on the carnivore community. As felids are top predators, we can predict that changes in this trophic level can lead to changes in ecosystem function and structure. Therefore, conservation efforts should be addressed to maintain the structure of these communities.},

We quantified activity patterns of terrestrial mammals in oil palm plantations and native riparian forest in Colombia to determine if species exhibited behavioural changes depending on the type of habitat and the presence of humans. Despite the large sampling effort (12,403 camera-days), we were only able to examine the activity patterns of ten species in riparian forests and seven species in oil palm plantations, with four species (capybara, giant anteater, lesser anteater and common opossum) being represented by enough records (i.e. n {\textgreater} 20) in both oil palm and forest to allow robust comparisons. Only capybaras showed an apparent change in activity patterns between oil palm plantations and riparian forests, shifting from being crepuscular in forest to predominantly nocturnal inside oil palm plantations. Further, capybaras, giant anteaters and white-tailed deer appeared to modify their activities to avoid human presence inside oil palm plantations by increasing nocturnality (temporal overlap  \$\${\textbackslash}widehat\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\$\$ranged from 0.13 to 0.36), whereas jaguarundi had high overlap with human activities [\$\${\textbackslash}widehat\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\$\$=0.85 (0.61–0.90)]. Species pair-wise analysis within oil palm revealed evidence for temporal segregation between species occupying the same trophic position (e.g. foxes and jaguarundi), whereas some predators and their prey (e.g. ocelots and armadillos) had high overlaps in temporal activity patterns as might be expected. Our findings shed light on the potential behavioural adaptation of mammals to anthropogenic landscapes, a feature not captured in traditional studies that focus on measures such as species richness or abundance.},

We present infanticide data from opportunistic sampling. Each month, from 2013 to 2015, we monitored pastures for evidence of livestock carcasses. A remotely triggered camera trap was placed at encountered fresh cattle carcasses. Through this monitoring, two cases of infanticide were recorded. Both cases occurred in close proximity to a cattle carcass, a large prey item that may attract multiple jaguars—including females with cubs around age of weaning—and increase the risk of infanticide. Our observations provide new empirical evidence of jaguar social behavior and intraspecific competitive interactions, potentially driven by locally high population density and resource provision.},

Both direct and indirect methods can be used to survey mammals, but the latter are preferred due to the difficulty to come in sight of and/or to capture the individuals, besides being cheaper. We compared the performance of two methods to survey medium and large-sized mammal: track plot recording and camera trapping, and their costs were assessed. At Jataí Ecological Station (S21°31'15"–W47°34'42"-Brazil) we installed ten camera traps along a dirt road directly in front of ten track plots, and monitored them for 10 days. We cleaned the plots, adjusted the cameras, and noted down the recorded species daily. Records taken by both methods showed they sample the local richness in different ways (Wilcoxon, T = 231; p ;; 0.01). The track plot method performed better on registering individuals whereas camera trapping provided records which permitted more accurate species identification. The type of infra-red sensor camera used showed a strong bias towards individual body mass (R2 = 0.70; p = 0.017), and the variable expenses of this method in a 10-day survey were estimated about 2.04 times higher compared to track plot method; however, in a long run camera trapping becomes cheaper than track plot recording. Concluding, track plot recording is good enough for quick surveys under a limited budget, and camera trapping is best for precise species identification and the investigation of species details, performing better for large animals. When used together, these methods can be complementary.},

We assessed the joint impacts of four non-native mammals (cattle, horse, European hare Lepus europaeus, and wild boar Sus scrofa) on seed surplus and seedling abundance of the Paraná pine (Araucaria angustifolia), a critically-endangered species of the Atlantic Forest. We found that its seeds constitute an autumn food resource for a native community richer than previously thought, with 70 bird and mammal species as confirmed or potential seed consumers, of which 40 were not previously recognized as such. We also recorded the number of uneaten seeds and seedlings at the middle-end of autumn under 520 female Paraná pine trees across the species’ distribution and identified signs of the species consuming seeds from each tree through direct observations combined with camera trapping. Most of the sampled trees (98\%) were visited by at least one seed consumer species, and over 60\% were visited by at least one non-native mammal. Seed surplus strongly declined in the presence of cattle, horses and wild boars, their impacts being additive, whereas the number of seedlings declined in the presence of European hares. Our results emphasize the importance of Paraná pine seeds for native fauna and the additive impact of invaders in a species-rich ecosystem. Seed predation by non-native species reduces the potential regeneration of Paraná pine forests, and may severely reduce food supply for its native consumers.},

Aiming to generate information to guide the choice of field protocols for surveying terrestrial large mammals in heterogeneous rainforest remnants, we compared the performance and the correlation between the results of two alternative techniques (track counts and camera trapping), and of two types of bait, in 24 forest remnants in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape. Techniques resulted in similar observed and estimated richness and species composition at the study landscape, including medium-sized and nocturnal species usually poorly represented in line-transect censuses. Although camera trapping resulted in a higher recording rate of the most common species (Didelphis aurita) and track counts in higher recording rates of some less common species (e.g. Dasypus novemcinctus), observed richness and recording rates of most species were correlated across the 24 sites between techniques. Conversely, the use of different baits strongly influenced results, indicating the importance of standardizing baits in comparative studies. Our results suggest that the two alternative techniques present similar performance and are suitable for studying the factors affecting the distribution of large mammals in altered rainforest landscapes. The choice of field protocols should then focus on the available resources and infrastructure, and on particularities of the study area.},

While most common sampling methods include live trapping (LT) and pitfall trapping (PT), camera trapping (CT) is potentially a useful technique. Studies assessing data acquisition efficiency for neotropical small mammals are mostly limited to LT and PT, and no small mammal study to date included CT. We provide a comparative assessment of the efficiency of LT (Sherman and wire-mesh traps), PT and CT in surveying small mammal species across 25 sites in an Amazonian archipelagic landscape. Based on 26,184 trap nights, we obtained 782 small mammal records representing at least 18 species. Most species were detected by both LT (72.2\%) and PT (83.3\%), but each of these methods exclusively recorded additional species, whereas CT detected only nearly one-fourth (N = 4) of all species recorded. Nevertheless, for nearly all species detected by CT, the probability of detecting individual species was similar or higher than that of LT. Species detected by CT represented the largest-bodied rodents and marsupials ({\textgreater} 200 g). Pitfall traps are an important complement to LT, and CT comprises an efficient technique to sample large-bodied small mammals. Improvements in the efficiency of camera traps in recording and identifying small-bodied species are both needed and possible, but we recommend the combination of LT and PT methods to enhance the completeness of community-wide small mammal sampling in neotropical forests.},

The first record of anomalous coloration for the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) was a leucistic cub captured in dense ombrophilous Atlantic Forest in the municipality of São José dos Pinhais, state of Paraná, southern Brazil, which was subsequently raised by residents until it was an adult. Collared peccarys’s behaviors are well documented in literature, but there is no published scientific information about the behavior of leucistic individuals. Here we report the second case of anomalous coloration of the collared peccary (P. tajacu) in Brazil and the Neotropical region, and comment on its social interaction with pigmented conspecifics. For a period of 27 months of monitoring, cameras trap captured 109 records (47 videos and 62 photos) distributed among 21 days. We retrieved 22 independent events from the records, of which 54.5\% were of the leucistic collared peccary alone and 45.5\% with it interacting with pigmented conspecifics. During interactions it displayed both affiliative and agonistic behaviors. Collared peccaries live in stable herds of five to 25 individuals, with temporary sub-herds of one to three individuals that forage separately for several hours during the day. Considering that animals with an absence of body pigmentation are more susceptible to predation, the survival of the leucistic collared peccary may be associated with its social interaction with pigmented conspecifics.},

	abstract = {In primate-non-primate commensalism, food is often the benefit. Here we report commensalism between the Endangered blonde capuchins (Sapajus flavius) and the newly discovered red-back agoutis (Dasyprocta iacki). We conducted the study in an Atlantic forest fragment in Northeast Brazil between September 2017 and August 2018. In three of those months, we observed 15 events of commensalism where the agoutis were feeding on leftover palm fruits from the blonde capuchins. We suspect that the red-back agoutis in the study area could be consuming more palm oil fruits when compared to agoutis inhabiting areas without the blonde capuchins. Comparison of the diet of agouti populations in such areas may help to test such a hypothesis. Also, due to the potential influence of the observer’s presence on the behaviour of the animals, further studies comparing sites through camera trapping may be another effective approach to test the hypothesis. Blonde capuchin food calls and the noises of fruits falling during the feeding bouts may serve as clues to attract the agoutis to consume the leftover palm fruits. Future studies using playback (or sound trapping associated with camera trapping) would be needed to confirm whether red-back agoutis are eavesdropping on blonde capuchins feeding noises to optimise their food and energy intakes.},

	abstract = {Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.},

However, some individuals have anomalous coloring patterns due to excess (melanism) or deficiency (albinism, leucism, or piebaldism) in melanin production. Although these anomalies occur in several species, there are few cited cases. Here, we report the occurrence of color anomalies in three Neotropical deer species. Data were obtained from wildlife inventories, through direct observation, camera-traps, and/or deer carcasses, between 2011 and 2020, in three biomes—the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado), and the Atlantic and Amazon Rain Forests. We registered 10 individuals with anomalous coloring from Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Amazonas and Rondônia states; seven Mazama gouazoubira (six piebalds and one leucistic), two piebald M. americana, and one piebald M. nemorivaga. Of the registered individuals, five were males, two females, and three of undetermined sex. To our knowledge, this is the largest set of anomalous coloring data for Neotropical deer. Even with the increasing reports of anomalous coloring, little is known about the factors that may cause this and how it influences the survival of individuals and consequently wild populations.},

We investigated whether temporal or dietary segregation plays a significant role in the coexistence of Neotropical small felids. In addition, we examined the role of prey activity in shaping their time use. We compared the activity and diet of four felids ( oncilla - Leopardus gutullus, margay - L. wiedii, jaguarundi - Puma yagouaroundi, and ocelot - L. pardalis) using camera trapping and scat surveys (45 sampling sites) in an Atlantic Forest remnant (35,000 ha) in Brazil. Ocelot, margay, and oncilla seem to be generalists and, overall, they consumed mammalian prey species of distinct sizes. As a consequence, we found moderate dietary overlap between all pairs of felids and low between ocelot and the other species. Oncilla and margay seem to be cathemeral, jaguarundi diurnal, and ocelot nocturnal, which resulted in low to moderate temporal overlap between them, potentially decreasing interspecific encounters. Predator-prey temporal overlap seems to be moderate for oncilla, margay, and jaguarundi, but high for ocelot. Our results suggest that time partitioning associated with dietary differences contribute to the coexistence of this Neotropical small-felid assemblage, and that prey activity is a factor shaping their activity pattern, especially for ocelot.},

	abstract = {Mineral licks—also known as “salados,” “saladeros,” or “collpas”—are specific sites in tropical and temperate ecosystems where a large diversity of mammals and birds come regularly to feed on soil. Although the reasons for vertebrate geophagy are not completely understood, animals are argued to obtain a variety of nutritional and health benefits from the ingestion of soil at mineral licks. We studied the temporal patterns of mineral lick use by white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) and red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) in a lowland rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Using camera and video traps at four different mineral licks, combined with behavioral follows of one group of spider monkeys, we documented rates of mineral lick visitation by both primate species and the relative frequency and intensity of mineral lick use by spider monkeys. On the basis of 1,612 days and 888 nights of mineral lick monitoring, we found that A. belzebuth and A. seniculus both visit mineral licks frequently throughout the year (on average ∼14\% of days for both species), and mineral lick visitation was influenced by short-term environmental conditions (e.g. sunny and dry weather). For spider monkeys, the area surrounding the lick was also the most frequently and most intensively used region within the group's home range. The fact that spider monkeys spent long periods at the lick area before coming to the ground to obtain soil, and the fact that both species visited the lick preferentially during dry sunny conditions (when predator detectability is presumed to be relatively high) and visited simultaneously more often than expected by chance, together suggest that licks are indeed perceived as risky areas by these primates. We suggest that howler and spider monkeys employ behavioral strategies aimed at minimizing the probability of predation while visiting the forest floor at risky mineral lick sites. Am. J.

Considering dispersal of Prosopis flexuosa seeds as case study, this work aimed at investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods for assessing the quantity component of seed dispersal effectiveness: exclosures and camera traps. Prosopis fruits were offered for 48 hr. Exclosure treatments were performed using two types of wire-screen cages, allowing access to ants (“closed exclosure”) and to small mammals up to 100 g (“open to small mammals”), and a treatment without exclosure (“open to all removers”). The camera trapping experiment was carried out using vertically oriented cameras placed at approximately 1.80 m height and focused on the fruits. The cameras were set in “motion detect mode,” taking series of three consecutive photographs. The exclosures largely allowed estimation of fruit removal by size-based groups of animals, but did not provide information on species identity. In contrast, camera traps were able to identify all visitors to species level and could not only determine the number of visits by each species but also the proportion of visits, which resulted in removal of fruits. Camera trapping allowed discriminating among small mammals playing different roles, without underestimating fruit removal by scatter-hoarding species. The quality of estimation of the quantity component of seed dispersal is remarkably better when the camera trapping method is applied. Additional information obtained, such as activity patterns of visitors, can contribute to a better understanding of the seed dispersal process.},

Collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) cannot eat some hard seeds, but can digest chemically defended seeds. Central American agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) gnaw through hard-walled seeds, but cannot consume chemically defended seeds. The objectives of this study were to determine relative peccary and agouti abundances within a lowland forest in Costa Rica and to assess how these two mammals affect the survival of large seeds that have no defenses (Iriartea deltoidea, Socratea exorrhiza), physical defenses (Astrocaryum alatum, Dipteryx panamensis), or chemical defenses (Mucuna holtonii) against seed predators. Mammal abundances were determined over 3 yrs from open-access motion-detecting camera trap photos. Using semi-permeable mammal exclosures and thread-marked seeds, predation and dispersal by mammals for each seed species were quantified. Abundances of peccaries were up to six times higher than those of agoutis over 3 yrs, but neither peccary nor agouti abundances differed across years. Seeds of A. alatum were predominantly dispersed by peccaries, which did not eat A. alatum seeds, whereas non-defended and chemically defended seeds suffered high levels of predation, mostly by peccaries. Agoutis did not eat M. holtonii seeds. Peccaries and agoutis did not differ in the distances they dispersed seeds. This study shows that seed fates are contingent upon many factors such as seed defenses, frugivore–granivore abundances, and seed-handling capabilities. Mammal–seed interactions are complex; the outcomes of these interactions depend on the inherent characteristics of seeds and their potential dispersers.},

Using a 14-yr mammal exclusion experiment, we demonstrate for the first time that a widespread and abundant Neotropical mammalian insectivore (Tamandua: Tamandua mexicana) reduced Azteca ant abundance. Azteca ant nests inside mammal exclosures were significantly larger than nests in control plots, where tamanduas were more abundant. These top-down effects were caused not only by direct consumption, but also through non-trophic direct effects, specifically nest damage. In contrast, tamanduas appeared to exert no significant top-down effect on termite prey, which have strong chemical defenses. Our results are consistent with theory that strong defenses against predation can mitigate the top-down effects of predators on some prey species. We argue that predicting the degree of top-down effects caused by predators requires both a quantitative knowledge of prey choice and an understanding of the anti-predator defenses of prey.},

Landscape-scale conservation strategies that include these forests are expected to have substantial benefits for biodiversity, especially for large mammals and birds that require extensive habitat but that are susceptible to extirpation due to synergies between logging and hunting. In addition, their responses to logging alone are poorly understood due to their cryptic behavior and low densities. In this study, we assessed the effects of logging and hunting on detection and occupancy rates of large vertebrates in a multiple-use forest on the Guiana Shield. Our study site was certified as being responsibly managed for timber production and indigenous communities are legally guaranteed use-rights to the forest. We coupled camera-trap data for wildlife detection with a spatially explicit dataset on indigenous hunting. A multi-species occupancy model found a weak positive effect of logging on occupancy and detection rates, while hunting had a weak negative effect. Model predictions of species richness were also higher in logged forest sites compared to unlogged forest sites. Density estimates for jaguars and ocelots in our multiple-use area were similar to estimates reported for fully protected areas. Involvement of local communities in forest management, control of forest access, and nesting production forests in a landscape that includes protected areas seemed important for these positive biodiversity outcomes. The maintenance of vertebrate species bodes well for both biodiversity and the humans that depend on multiple-use forests.},

We found a negative correlation between the distance from wind farms and the occupancy probability of the jaguar, and a positive correlation with the occupancy probability of the jaguarundi. Puma and jaguarundi occupied primarily sites near watercourses, whereas the occupancy of the crab-eating fox was correlated positively with the presence of poachers. The ocelot was detected more frequently at sites distant from human settlements, whereas the jaguar was detected more often in areas far from wind farms. We found a negative correlation between the distance of water and the detection of the ocelot. The detection of the crab-eating fox was influenced positively by the detection of cattle. In addition to the negative influence of some anthropic activities, our results indicate that water is a very important resource for species, and the few permanent sources of this resource available in the area must be preserved. The replication of our research in other systems, worldwide, that are experiencing similar pressures, should permit a systematic evaluation of the management and conservation strategies needed to rebuild or maintain populations, restore ecosystems, and support conservation policies in human-altered landscapes.

While this species is apparently associated with forested habitats, it also appears tolerant of some anthropogenic disturbance. We deployed 57 unbaited camera traps (n = 4923 trap-days) in and around a protected area (Furnas do Bom Jesus State Park, São Paulo, Brazil) to survey for tayra and two potentially interactive species: puma (Puma concolor) and free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris). We used encounter histories generated from photographs and occupancy models to quantify tayra landscape use in the human-dominated landscape composed of the protected area that was near a city and surrounded by agricultural lands dominated by small farms. We fit co-occurrence models to understand whether puma and free-ranging dogs affected landscape use by tayra. We detected tayra at 44\% of sites and found that tayra landscape use increased with the proportion of forest cover within 500 m of the sampling site. Other factors predicting tayra landscape use included whether the sampling site was within the protected area, its distance to water, and slope. Dogs, which are common on the periphery of the protected area, seem to have a weak negative effect on tayra landscape use. Because of the concentration of forest within the park, this is an important protected area for the carnivore population within this human-modified landscape. Thus, environmental variables, such as forest cover, distance to water, as well as administrative protection status, are important for understanding local-scale tayra distribution.

	abstract = {Scavenging is widespread among vertebrates, being very important for maintaining certain ecosystem functions. Despite this, the scavenger communities remain poorly known in some biomes, especially in the Neotropics. Our main objective was to describe for the first time the scavenger community and identify the factors affecting scavenging efficiency in the Brazilian Cerrado. We analyzed the effects of vegetation cover, time of carcass placement and carcass weight, on scavenger species richness, individual abundances, carcass detection and consumption times, and carcass consumption rate. We monitored 11 large and 45 small carcasses using automatic cameras. We documented a total of 19 vertebrate scavenging species, four species of vultures and 15 facultative scavengers. We found that carcass size was the most important factor affecting the scavenger assemblage and consumption patterns. Large carcasses were dominated by vultures, whereas small carcasses were consumed mainly by facultative scavengers. We also found differences between large and small carcasses in all carcass consumption variables except for detection time. However, we did not find an effect of vegetation cover or time of carcass placement on scavenging patterns. The negligible role of mammals and non-raptor birds in large carcasses is also noteworthy, probably due to the consumption and foraging efficiency of the vultures, and the more frugivorous habits of the mesocarnivores. Our results show a highly diverse and efficient scavenging vertebrate community in the Brazilian Cerrado, and the need to preserve them in the face of the significant habitat transformations suffered by this biodiversity hotspot.

	abstract = {Plants frequently display fruit characteristics that support multiple seed-dispersal syndromes. These ambiguous characteristics may reflect the fact that seed dispersal is usually a complex process involving multiple dispersers. This is the case for the Neotropical ginger Renealmia alpinia (Zingiberaceae). It was originally suggested that the aromatic fruits of R. alpinia located at the base of the plant are adapted for terrestrial mammal seed dispersal. However, the dark-purple coloration of the fruits and bright orange aril surrounding the seeds suggest that birds may play a role in R. alpinia seed dispersal. At La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we used camera traps to record vertebrate visits to infructescences of R. alpinia. Most visitors were toucans and aracaris (Ramphastidae). However fruits were also removed by terrestrial mammals (coatis and armadillos). In addition to vertebrate fruit removal, some of the fruits dehisce and the seeds that fall on the ground are dispersed by ants. Fruitfall traps showed that 77 percent of fruits are removed by vertebrates. However, 15 percent of fruits fall to the base of parent plants to be potentially dispersed by ants. Experiments using a laboratory ant colony showed that ants are effective seed dispersers of R. alpinia. Ant seed manipulation increased germination success and reduced time to germination. In conclusion, primary seed dispersal in the Neotropical ginger R. alpinia is mostly performed by birds, additionally ants are effective dispersers at short distances. Seed dispersal in R. alpinia is a complex process involving a diverse array of dispersal agents.},

	abstract = {Relative abundance indices are often used to compare species abundance between sites. The indices assume that species have similar detection probabilities, or that differences between detection probabilities are known and can be corrected for. Indices often consist of encounter frequencies of footprints, burrows, markings or photo captures along trails or transect lines, but the assumption of equal detection probabilities is rarely validated. This study analyzes detection probabilities of a range of Neotropical mammals on trails in dense secondary forests, using camera-trap and track data. Photo captures of the two large cats, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), were correlated solely with trail variables, while photo captures of their potential prey species had no correlation or negative correlation with trail variables. The Neotropical mammals varied greatly in their tendency to follow or cross trails based on footprints surveys. This indicates that camera locations on trails will have varying detection probability for these Neotropical mammals. Even the two similar-sized jaguars and pumas, occupying relatively similar niches, differed subtly in their use of trails. Pumas followed trails more completely while jaguars were more likely to deviate from trails. The ecological significance of these findings is that jaguars seem to be more willing to use the forest matrix away from trails than do pumas. We conclude that trail-based indices, such as photographic captures or tracks along trails, are not appropriate for comparison between Neotropical species, and not even between relatively similar species like jaguars and pumas.},

We present the first density estimation of Baird's tapir for the Talamanca mountains of Costa Rica, and one of the first for the country. Ten stations with paired cameras were established in Valle del Silencio within Parque Internacional La Amistad (PILA). Seventy-seven tapir pictures of 15 individuals comprising 25 capture–recapture events were analyzed using mark-recapture techniques. The 100\% minimum convex polygon of the sampled area was 5.7 km2 and the effective sampled area using half mean maximum distances moved by tapirs was 7.16 km2. We estimated a tapir density of 2.93 individuals/km2 which represents the highest density reported for this species. Intermountain valleys can represent unique and important habitats for large mammal species. However, the extent of isolation of this population, potentially constrained by steep slopes of the cordillera, remains unknown. Further genetic and movement studies are required to understand meta-population dynamics and connectivity between lowland and highland areas for Baird's tapir conservation in Costa Rica.},

We aimed at understanding whether the replacement of forests and grasslands by tree plantations leads to biotic homogenization of mammal assemblages of two contrasting Neotropical ecoregions or if dispersal or environmental limitations keep their original assemblages clearly differentiated. Location Argentina, Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest, Southern Cone Mesopotamian Savannas and Iberá marshes. Taxon Mammals. Methods We conducted two camera-trap surveys, deploying 184 camera-trap stations in continuous forest, fragmented forest and pine plantations in the Atlantic Forest, and 234 in grassland, fragmented forest and pine plantations in the Mesopotamian Savannas. We evaluated the similarity of the assemblages among the environments and regions, generating all possible pairwise comparisons using three similarity indices: Sørensen (species identity), Horn (common species) and Morisita-Horn (dominant species). Using variation partitioning diagrams and redundancy analysis, we evaluated the spatial structure of mammal assemblages and the influence of environmental variables. Results There was a greater similarity in species identity between different environments within each region than between similar environments in different regions. Common and dominant mammal assemblages of tree plantations tended to be similar between regions and were different from assemblages of the natural environments within the same region. Fragmented forest assemblages were very similar among regions. Assemblages were spatially structured but most of the variation between regions was explained by the environmental variables. Main conclusions Each region has a distinct pool of species, which is partially explained by environmental factors, such as the differential representation of native environments in the landscape. However, an expansion of tree plantations and forest fragmentation in the Atlantic Forest could lead to biotic homogenization between regions due to an increase in the abundance of generalist species.},

	abstract = {The ecology of the jaguarundi is poorly known, so I reviewed the literature for all original data and remarks on jaguarundi observations, ecology, and behaviour, to synthesize what is known about the species. Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600 h–1800 h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are ≤25 km2; females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species.},

Based on a systematic review, we compiled data on over 1000 mammal inventories conducted throughout the Neotropics – from Mexico to Argentina – to document the status of assemblage-wide field mammalogy in the world’s most biodiverse Tropical realm. We analysed data using descriptive statistics and a confusion matrix to understand the prevalence of species' pseudo-absences, map overall patterns of survey density, and quantify any geographic sampling bias. Based on the 1028 site-specific inventories published between 1983 and 2020, mean species richness of medium- to large-bodied mammals was 11.9 (± 8.8 standard deviation). Local inventories were distributed across elevational gradients, and overall sampling effort and survey techniques employed were extremely variable. The best-sampled regions were the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Mesoamerica, but we identified nine large assemblage-wide Wallacean shortfalls and a pseudo-absence rate of 11\% (± 4\% standard deviation); geographic sampling bias was largely related to human population density, regardless of the assemblages’ intactness presumably found in the undersampled wilderness regions of the Neotropics. We document the 40-year legacy of mammal field surveys throughout the Neotropics, where several glaring knowledge shortfalls still persist. This calls for an audacious research agenda for future Neotropical mammal studies, which should target sampling in more remote areas, standardise sampling methodology, and provide high-resolution data that can be used to fill current knowledge shortfalls. To do so, Latin American countries and the wider international community will need to commit greater personnel and financial resources to understanding biodiversity patterns and processes related to the Tropical vertebrate fauna.},

In addition to the low availability of water, carnivorous mammals are still exposed to a number of threats related to landscape modifications. We used data from camera traps and occupancy models to investigate the habitat use by carnivores in an area of Caatinga in northeastern Brazil. We found a negative correlation between the distance from wind farms and the occupancy probability of the jaguar, and a positive correlation with the occupancy probability of the jaguarundi. Puma and jaguarundi occupied primarily sites near watercourses, whereas the occupancy of the crab-eating fox was correlated positively with the presence of poachers. The ocelot was detected more frequently at sites distant from human settlements, whereas the jaguar was detected more often in areas far from wind farms. We found a negative correlation between the distance of water and the detection of the ocelot. The detection of the crab-eating fox was influenced positively by the detection of cattle. In addition to the negative influence of some anthropic activities, our results indicate that water is a very important resource for species, and the few permanent sources of this resource available in the area must be preserved. The replication of our research in other systems, worldwide, that are experiencing similar pressures, should permit a systematic evaluation of the management and conservation strategies needed to rebuild or maintain populations, restore ecosystems, and support conservation policies in human-altered landscapes.

Given this, the objective of this paper is to assess the efficiency of camera trapping as an inventory technique for Neotropical forests in general and Atlantic forest in particular. The study was conducted at the Santa Lúcia Biological Station (SLBS), a biologically rich Atlantic Forest preserve located in south-eastern Brazil (Mendes \& Padovan 2000) where mammals have been intensively live-trapped, observed from line-transects or had indirect evidence of their presence (faeces, footprints, scratches, etc.) recorded in earlier years (Passamani et al. 2000).},

	abstract = {Raphia taedigera is a wetland palm species that occurs in monospecific stands in Central and South America, Africa, and Madagascar. Use of this ecosystem by wildlife is largely unknown. We surveyed R. taedigera stands at the Osa Biological Corridor in Costa Rica using 26 camera traps to identify which large (\&gt;1 kg) mammal species use this habitat and the distance each species will travel into it from the surrounding habitats. We conclude that R. taedigera provides habitat and a connectivity function in the Osa region for coati ( Nasua narica ), raccoon ( Procyon sp.), collared peccary ( Pecari tajacu ), white-faced capuchin ( Cebus capucinus ), ocelot ( Leopardus pardalis ), northern tamandua ( Tamandua mexicana ), and paca ( Cuniculus paca ). Other species were detected only on the edges of stands or not at all. On the basis of literature review, interviews with farmers, frequent detections of collared peccary, and detection in adjacent habitat, the jaguar ( Panthera onca ) is also expected to traverse R. taedigera stands. Raphia taedigera stands can be considered an important habitat for maintaining connectivity across the Osa Biological Corridor and potentially provide a similar function in other Neotropical landscapes.},

However, little is known of its ecology in the semi-arid Caatinga biome, and this study aimed to characterise the ecological niche of the species in Sergipe, in the northeastern extreme of the country. The study was conducted over a period of 13 months, at the Grota do Angico Natural Monument (2138 ha), with monthly campaigns of 6 days in arboreal-shrubby caatinga, riparian forest, and grota (humid gallery forest). Sand plots and camera traps were used to collect records of the species, and faecal samples were collected whenever found during the monitoring of the plots. A total of 407 records of C. thous were obtained, with 308 in the plots and 99 in the traps. The species occurred throughout the entire study area, with no significant variation being found in the use of habitat (p=0.1123). The monthly records were not randomly distributed (p=0.009), being concentrated between November and June, although no clear seasonal pattern was identified (p=0.383). The diet was classified as omnivorous, with a predominance of arthropods and fruit. Activity was primarily nocturnal, with no records being collected between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.},

	abstract = {Abstract Context Urban protected areas (PAs) are the habitat of several Neotropical medium-sized wild mammal (MSWM) species. However, this richness is seriously threatened by the growing populations of free-ranging dogs and cats in these areas. Aims The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of free-ranging dogs and cats on the assemblage structure of MSWM in PAs of Xalapa city, Veracruz, Mexico. Methods Camera traps were used to assess the effect of abundance and activity of dogs and cats on richness, abundance, dominance and activity of MSWM across two urban and three peri-urban PAs. The effect of plant diversity, vegetation structure and PA on mammal richness, activity and abundance were also evaluated. Key results The dominance of MSWM was higher in peri-urban areas than urban areas, and the activity of dogs and cats from peri-urban and urban PAs was similar with wildest MSWM. Only inside urban areas did the size of the area and the dogs’ activity have a negative effect on the richness, activity and abundance of MSWM. Moreover, the activity and abundance of cats also had a negative effect on the activity of MSWM in urban PAs. The presence of dogs affected the latency of appearance of MSWM. Conclusions The presence of free-ranging dogs and cats in urban PAs affects MSWM assemblages and their appearance latency. Implications The potential harm of free-ranging dogs and cats on the community of MSWM in urban areas is clear, as is the need for increased scientific research to aid in the control of these exotic species in urban landscapes.},

	abstract = {Hydropower projects are rapidly expanding across lowland Amazonia, driving the conversion of large tracts of once-continuous forests into archipelagos embedded within a vast open-water matrix. Forest vertebrate populations thus become stranded in habitat islands, with their persistence governed by a combination of species life-history traits, habitat patch, and landscape context. We investigate the patterns of species extinction of 34 arboreal and terrestrial vertebrate species within three continuous forest sites and 37 land-bridge islands within one of the largest South American hydroelectric reservoirs, based on a combination of camera trapping, line-transect censuses, sign surveys, and armadillo burrow counts. Forest area was the best predictor of species persistence, so we classified all species into three levels of vulnerability to habitat insularization, with most species defined as ‘area-sensitive’. However, island occupancy was decisively determined by individual species traits, with wide-ranging species and poor dispersers showing high local extinction rates. We detected higher island occupancy rates of large vertebrate species compared to other Neotropical fragmented forest landscapes, suggesting that this is critically attributed to the absence of hunting pressure at Balbina. Nevertheless, most terrestrial and arboreal species have been driven to local extinction within the vast majority of islands, which have been largely defaunated. We predicted species composition across all 3546 islands within the reservoir, indicating that only ⩽2\% of all islands continue to harbour at least 75\% of all species. To minimise loss of vertebrate diversity, future hydroelectric dam projects in lowland tropical forests, if unavoidable, should consider their geographic location and landscape structure to maximise both island size and landscape connectivity, and set aside strictly protected reserves within reservoir areas.},

Citizen scientists documented 29 native mammal and bird species among 5639 photo records obtained at fruiting trees. Analyses of 3 sets of camera-trap samples comprising: (1) only Attalea phalerata palms, (2) all ten dominant fruiting-tree species, and (3) all except a species with a highly-valued fruit and an unusual distribution, showed that faunal composition in low cattle-impact areas was significantly different and more diverse compared to that in high cattle-impact areas. Long-term cattle-related alterations of forest vegetation and short-term fruit depletion and interference by cattle explained faunal differences. While 5 frugivores and 1 carnivore were consistent indicators of low cattle-impact conditions, the value of 2 other frugivores (Tayassu pecari and Crax fasciolata) as indicators of cattle impact varied depending on fruit-species nutritive value, timing, and distribution. Improved cattle management is needed to prevent additional loss of forest biodiversity.},

	abstract = {As oil palm plantations continue to expand in Neotropical regions, identifying critical transitions in land use, at which animal communities can be drastically altered, is crucial for conservation planning. Here, we investigated potential unexpected change points (thresholds) in the response of terrestrial mammal's richness and community composition to increasing oil palm cover in the Llanos region of Colombia. We deployed camera traps to detect species across 56 sites (landscapes of {\textasciitilde}220 ha each) and used segmented regression and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) for the identification of these thresholds. We found a negative linear relationship between the proportion of oil palm and species richness, but no evidence of a threshold. In contrast, we found strong signs of a community threshold when oil palm cover in the study area reached 45–75\%, at which mammalian species composition (taxon-specific changes of abundance and occurrence frequency) drastically changed. When species were assessed individually, a significant threshold relationship to oil palm cover was found to occur in 10 of the 15 examined species, with four (squirrel, agouti, spiny rat, common opossum) having a negative drastic change at approximately 45\% oil palm cover. Five species showed no evidence for any critical threshold (giant and lesser anteater, jaguarondi, white-tailed deer and raccoon). We used the community threshold identified above as a baseline to evaluate the conservation status of the four oil palm production zones in Colombia. We found that approximately 41\% of the total area covered by oil palm in Colombia has crossed the identified threshold of 45–75\%, suggesting urgent need for forest restoration to increase its extent if a collapse of their resident mammal communities is to be avoided. These findings provide guidance for the design of sustainable landscapes within production areas in Colombia to promote the conservation of terrestrial mammals.},

	abstract = {As human-modified landscapes are increasing in the tropics, it becomes critical to understand how they affect mammal communities to reconcile conservation and development. We combined land cover information and camera-trapping data to explore the effects of agricultural expansion on mammals in the Magdalena river valley of Colombia. We estimated species diversity, evenness, and dominance across two agricultural landscapes, modified by cattle ranching and oil palm cultivation. We further assessed which variables influence species- and community-level occupancy using multi-species occupancy models. Results highlight that modified landscapes display lower species richness, diversity and evenness, and higher dominance than more pristine sites. Residual forest cover and distance to water had significant effect on community occupancy (positive and negative respectively). Forests were particularly important for pumas, ocelots, lowland pacas, Central American agoutis, and crab-eating raccoons while wetlands had a positive effect on jaguars, the apex predator in the region. The influence of anthropogenic pressure was not clearly evident, though pastures were not valuable habitats for any mammal species, as they had a negative, yet not significant, effect on species and community occupancy. In light of rapidly expanding agriculture across the tropics, our findings highlight species-specific responses to disturbance that can inform land use planning and conservation policies. We stress the conservation value of forest and wetland habitat to mammal occupancy in heterogeneous ecosystems. Moreover, our results demonstrate that oil palm and crop expansion should target existing pastures, which displayed limited conservation value for Neotropical mammals but occupy vast swathes of land across Latin America.},

	abstract = {The landscape of fear has profound effects on the species behavior, with most organisms engaging in risk avoidance behaviors in areas perceived as riskier. Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 \% more nocturnal and three species become 11.7\% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans’ avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defaunation.},

Despite being a priority region for biodiversity conservation, the role of protected and unprotected forest remnants for long-term species conservation is unknown. Here, we unveil the main patterns of occurrence and distribution of medium- and large-sized mammals in remnants of the Atlantic Forest of Southern Bahia, to generate subsidies for applied conservation strategies. We recorded mammals using camera-traps, active search, and/or line-transect surveys and complemented our species list with literature data. We thus obtained information on richness attributes, relative abundance, and biomass of mammal species per forest remnant, compared assemblages in protected and unprotected areas, and finally investigated both species-area and biomass-area relationships. From 72 forest remnants assessed, we recorded 45 mammal species, including 19 threatened locally. Protected areas were richer in species, especially concerning threatened ones, and concentrated most of the mammal biomass, which presented consistently low values for most areas. The positive and significant species-area and biomass-area relationships further corroborate these patterns since protected areas are larger in size. Despite the historic anthropogenic pressures, we conclude that Southern Bahia still harbors an expressive mammal diversity, with protected areas being critical to maintain most of the species' richness and biomass across the entire region. Nevertheless, small unprotected remnants ({\textless}100 ha) safeguard mammal species, including threatened ones, stressing their importance to maintain mammal assemblages in one of the most important hotpoints of the entire biome.},

	abstract = {In a scenario where escalating human activities lead to several environmental changes and, consequently, affect mammal abundance and distribution, β-diversity may increase due to differences among sites. Using the ecological uniqueness approach, we analyzed β-diversity patterns of ground-dwelling mammal communities recorded through comprehensive camera trap monitoring within eight tropical forests protected areas in Mesoamerica and South America under variable landscape contexts. We aimed to investigate whether the contribution of single sites (LCBD) and single species (SCBD) to overall β-diversity could be explained by community metrics and environmental variables, and by species metrics and biological traits, respectively. Total β-diversity was also partitioned into species replacement and richness difference. We related LCBD to species richness, total relative abundance, functional indices, and environmental variables (tree basal area, protected area size, NDVI, and precipitation seasonality), and SCBD to species naïve occupancy, relative abundance, and morphoecological traits via beta regression. Our findings showed that LCBD was primarily explained by variation in species richness, rather than relative abundance and functional metrics. Protected area size and tree basal area were also important in explaining variation in LCBD. SCBD was strongly related to naïve occupancy and relative abundance, but not to biological traits, such as body mass, trophic energy level, activity cycle, and taxonomic category. Local β-diversity was a result of species replacements and to a lesser extent differences in species richness. Our approach was useful in examining and comparing the ecological uniqueness among different sites, revealing the regional scale current status of mammal diversity. High LCBD values comprised sites embedded within smaller habitat extents, hosting lower tree basal areas, and harboring low species richness. SCBD showed that relatively ubiquitous species that occur at variable abundances across sites contributed most to β-diversity.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of both seed density and distance from conspecific adult trees on the survivorship of seeds of Shorea laxa and Dipterocarpus tempehes. We examined whether those species support predictions of the escape hypothesis of distance- and density-dependent mortality. We placed seeds on the forest floor using a matrix of distance from the parent tree (5, 20, and 80m) and seed density (2, 10, and 50m−2). The fates of seeds and seedlings were recorded 5 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month after the seeds were exposed. Camera-traps at quadrats 5 and 80m from the parent trees were used to identify mammalian seed and seedling predators and to examine the frequency of their appearance. The proportion of seedlings surviving after 1 month was very small, 32.0 and 4.0\% for S. laxa and D. tempehes, respectively. The main cause of mortality for both species was predation and removal by mammals. Total mortality and mortality caused by mammal predation were highest at the greatest distance from the parent tree. Camera-traps revealed that the diversity of mammalian predators was highest 5m from the parent trees, while the total frequency of mammalian predator appearance was higher at 80m than at 5m for S. laxa. Thus, S. laxa and D. tempehes exhibited distance-dependent mortality, but the highest mortality occurred at the greatest distance from the parent trees. This is the inverse of the pattern predicted by escape hypothesis and instead supports the “McCanny pattern”. Those results would be caused by “predator satiation” near the seed-bearing trees where foods were concentrated, while seeds more distant from the parent tree were exhausted by predation.},

	abstract = {Defaunation, invasive species and forest fragmentation are considered to be the major drivers for the disruption of key ecological processes, particularly those related to plant animal-interactions such as seed dispersal and predation. The disruption of critical phases in the plant life cycle may ultimately have negative impacts on plant recruitment and the survival of plant populations. Here, for the first time we compared the seed removal and recruitment of Araucaria angustifolia, a critically endangered and relictual gymnosperm species, in multiple sites, including continuous and fragmented forest areas in the Brazilian Atlantic subtropical forest. Our sampling included seed removal experiment monitored by camera traps and surveys of A. angustifolia recruitment. We found that seed survival and recruitment were related to the density of adult A. angustifolia. Therefore the formation of large and dense groves, which is a characteristic of pristine Araucaria moist forests endangered by forest fragmentation and selective logging, may be an attempt to satiate seed predator communities. Additionally, forest fragmentation and the introduction of wild boar decreased seed survival to very low, and forest fragmentation decreased recruitment by fourfold on average. Increase protection and recuperation of Araucaria moist forests and the eradication of the invasive wild boar where possible are necessary measures for increasing seed survival rates and the recruitment of this relictual conifer.},

Behavioral mechanisms that facilitate species coexistence have been poorly explored and may explain the lack of community-wide morphological character displacement in some carnivore assemblages. We use the results of large-scale and intensive camera-trap surveys conducted in the Atlantic Forest of NE Argentina between 2003 and 2008 to describe the spatial patterns of detection and the daily pattern of records of the six wild cat species present in the region (jaguar Panthera onca, puma Puma concolor, ocelot Leopardus pardalis, jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi, margay Leopardus wiedii, and oncilla Leopardus tigrinus). We use these patterns to generate hypotheses about behavioral differences that may facilitate species coexistence. The larger species were more frequently recorded in the better-protected areas, probably as a result of anthropogenic effects (poaching of cats and their prey). Competitive release from ocelots and jaguarundis may explain why the oncilla and the margay showed the opposite pattern. Morphologically similar species had the most contrasting activity patterns: the margay was exclusively nocturnal and the jaguarundi diurnal. The other species were cathemeral, but alternated their peaks of activity in relation to the relative order of their body weights. The contrasting temporal patterns observed and the ability of pumas and oncillas to adjust their activity patterns to local conditions may facilitate the coexistence of these cat species and explain the lack of character displacement in this assemblage.},

	abstract = {Mammalian frugivory is a distinctive biotic interaction of tropical forests; however, most efforts in the Neotropics have focused on cases of animals foraging in the forest canopy, in particular primates and bats. In contrast much less is known about this interaction when it involves fruits deposited on the forest floor and terrestrial mammals. We conducted a camera-trapping survey to analyze the characteristics of the mammalian ensembles visiting fruits of Licania platypus and Pouteria sapota deposited on the forest floor in a well preserved tropical rainforest of Mexico. Both tree species produce large fruits but contrast in their population densities and fruit chemical composition. In particular, we expected that more species of terrestrial mammals would consume P. sapota fruits due to its higher pulp:seed ratio, lower availability and greater carbohydrate content. We monitored fruits at the base of 13 trees (P. sapota, n = 4 and L. platypus, n = 9) using camera-traps. We recorded 13 mammal species from which we had evidence of 8 consuming or removing fruits. These eight species accounted for 70\% of the species of mammalian frugivores active in the forest floor of our study area. The ensemble of frugivores associated with L. platypus (6 spp.) was a subset of that associated with P. sapota (8 spp). Large body-sized species such as Tapirus bairdii, Pecari tajacu and Cuniculus paca were the mammals more frequently interacting with fruits of the focal species. Our results further our understanding of the characteristics of the interaction between terrestrial mammalian frugivores and large-sized fruits, helping to gain a more balanced view of its importance across different tropical forests and providing a baseline to compare against defaunated forests.},

The present study was conducted in two reserves in an Atlantic Forest area in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil, and provided information on several large mammal species through photographic records. Records were related to certain environmental parameters, such as width of passages (trails and roads), vegetation density and proximity to water, in order to assess the relationship between each mammal species and its microhabitat. Thirty-two camera trap stations were placed during 17 months for 150.8 (±62.2) days on average. Terrestrial mammals tended to use different habitats: Puma concolor used mainly dirt roads and open areas; Leopardus pardalis, Cerdocyon thous and Nasua nasua used more large trails and intermediate-forested sites; and Cuniculus paca, Dasypus novemcinctus, Leopardus tigrinus, Eira barbara and Leopardus wiedii were recorded more often on narrow trails and in densely forested sites. Some of these forest species, such as D. novemcinctus, C. paca and L. pardalis, also showed relationships with watercourses. Information on habitat selection allows more effort to be addressed to the habitat associated with focal species, and indicates the significance of environmental heterogeneity, which makes it possible for species to coexist.},

	abstract = {Camera trapping has been widely used to study different aspects of animal ecology, increasing scientific knowledge and helping in conservation initiatives. Recently, some studies demonstrated the use of this technique to study temporal predator-prey interactions, most of which focused on large felids. In this study, we investigate the activity patterns of the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis)—a medium-sized neotropical cat—and its known potential prey in the Brazilian Pantanal using photographs taken by camera traps. We tested for seasonal differences in activity patterns, and assessed the patterns of temporal overlap between this felid and three known potential prey: the Brazilian rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), Azara’s agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), and Paraguayan punaré (Thrichomys pachyurus). We estimated activity patterns using kernel density and measured the overlap between estimated paired distributions using a coefficient of overlap, hypothesizing that activity patterns would change between the rainy and dry season, and that overlap would be higher with rodents since they comprise the bulk of the ocelot’s diet in the Pantanal and elsewhere. Azara’s agouti and the Paraguayan punaré were the only species that presented significant changes in their activity patterns between seasons. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was low coincidence of activity patterns between ocelots and Azara’s agouti for both seasons, but temporal overlap between ocelots and Paraguayan punarés was high with no significant difference, at least in the dry season. Overall, temporal overlap between ocelots and Brazilian rabbits was high, with no significant differences. In general, our results suggest that ocelots may tailor their activity to that of some of their potential prey to increase the probability of encounters. The results provide the first insight into temporal interactions involving ocelots and their potential prey in the Brazilian Pantanal.},

	abstract = {The South American coati Nasua nasua is a relatively common species throughout the Neotropical region. Despite this, ecological information on the species, including its biological interactions and habitat use, is scarce, especially for the Andes. In some regions, Nasua nasua is sympatric with other closely related species of the Procyonidae family, including the mountain coati Nasuella olivacea. Here, we assess the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the occupancy of these two species and the spatial and temporal bases of their co-occurrence along an elevational gradient. Camera trapping (with 85 camera-trap stations) was conducted during the dry season of 2016 along elevations from 1600 to 3600 m above sea level (m. a. s. l.) in northern Peru. We observed a total of 244 detections for Nasua nasua and 17 for Nasuella olivacea over 9457 cumulative camera-days. Occupancy modelling (Royle-Nichols model) showed that Nasua nasua occupancy was significantly and negatively related to elevation but positively related to forest cover. In contrast, Nasuella olivacea occupancy was significantly and positively related to elevation. In addition, Nasuella olivacea was detected in only 5 of the 45 total sites occupied by Nasua nasua; therefore, spatial overlap was low. Consequently, co-occurrence modelling based on a Bayesian approach showed no evidence of avoidance between the two coati species. Additionally, activity patterns suggest low levels of temporal overlap; however, we consider this a preliminary finding due to the limited number of detections for Nasuella olivacea. Our results not only increase the understanding of the ecology of both Nasua nasua and Nasuella olivacea but also provide information towards their conservation in this part of their distribution range.},

Here, we use camera-trap surveys to assess whether forests in Central Panama, the narrowest and most disturbed portion of the Isthmus, still have intact communities of medium- and large-bodied terrestrial mammals. During 2005–2014, we collected camera-trap survey data from 15 national parks and forest fragments on both sides of the Panama Canal, and compared these to similar data from two sites in the intact Darién National Park in Eastern Panama, the nearest available reference. We found that most sites in Central Panama – including some of the national parks – had lower mammal species richness and evenness than the reference sites, and less structurally-complex mammal communities. Forests in Central Panama had little or no apex predators and large terrestrial frugivores, with the exception of two sites directly connected to the reference site. Our results indicate that the terrestrial mammal community in forests of Central Panama is currently degraded, even inside national parks. These data provide a baseline for evaluating the success of conservation efforts to prevent the Panamanian Isthmus to become a bottleneck for movement of animals.},

To better understand the impact of protected areas on mammal conservation in the Amazon Basin, this study evaluates the diversity, abundance, and conservation status of medium and large forest mammals in a borderland sector of Peru’s Ichigkat Muja - Cordillera del Cóndor National Park. Over two field seasons, a total of 26 medium and large forest-dwelling mammal species belonging to 19 families were recorded using camera traps and field surveys. In comparison with regional reference sites, 63\% of the mammal species recorded in the regional reference sites were documented in the study area. The drivers of species diversity and abundance within the study area were assessed using park guard reports, published literature, and regression analysis, and the intactness of the local mammal fauna was evaluated using regional comparison sites. A combination of factors explain the diversity and abundance of the mammal fauna recorded in the protected study area, including regional geography and human activities. Given the location of the protected area in Peru and its adjacency to the border of Ecuador, long-term conservation of the park’s mammals depends on binational efforts that invest in collaborative institutions and local communities. This case study provides an example of how borderland protected areas can present challenging wildlife conservation scenarios that require binational collaboration. The current condition and at-risk status of mammal fauna in the protected study area also underlines the importance of consistent field-based monitoring to inform management and evaluate protected area effectiveness.},

Using a camera-trap design (85 stations, 8,825 camera days, 317 km2), we recorded a total of 33 mammalian species during the dry season of 2016. Species-specific effects of environmental covariates based on multi-species occupancy modeling showed that only elevation had a statistically significant effect on occupancy. Also, a principal coordinate analysis and a distance-based redundancy analysis suggested that the variation in species composition is mainly explained by elevation, and moderately by both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the distance to roads. The highlands appear to be dominated by a reduced assembly of species consisting of the montane guinea pig, the Andean fox, and the northern pudu. Functional diversity decreased with elevation, providing evidence that lowland and highland communities are functionally dissimilar. Moreover, land-use is changing rapidly in the areas surrounding the TNNS, suggesting that increased connectivity at the two extremes of the elevational gradient (the highlands and the lowlands) will ensure the long-term viability of terrestrial mammalian populations and, thus, the ecological processes in which they are involved.},

Three birds, the Channel-billed Toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus), Speckled Chachalaca (Ortalis guttata) and White-necked Thrush (Turdus albicollis), and four mammal species, the coati (Nasua nasua), russet rice rat (Euryoryzomys russatus), South American water rat (Nectomys squamipes) and the tayra (Eira barbara) were identified. The highest number of feeding events was recorded for O. guttata, followed by R. vitellinus and E. russatus. Although the number of detected species was low, seed dispersal of E. edulis fruits on Santa Catarina Island is likely still performed by birds and small mammals.},

We obtained 352 independent detections of three invasive mammal species: 67\% European hare (Lepus europaeus), 32\% wild boar (Sus scrofa), and 1\% red deer (Cervus elaphus); no native herbivorous or omnivorous mammals were detected. All species showed nocturnal activity patterns. Hare detections reflected generalist habitat use and wild boars showed preference for more humid areas. The increased detection near roads suggests hares and wild boars are being facilitated through human disturbance, which should be considered in management decisions.},

The conservation status needs to be updated since no recent studies have been conducted in the Atlantic Forest. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the density, occupancy and detectability of D. leporina in one of the larger Atlantic Forest remnants in Espírito Santo, Brazil, the Vale Natural Reserve (VNR). We surveyed four line transects between April 2013 and May 2014 to estimate density and abundance. To model occupancy probability, as well as to document activity pattern, we selected 39 sampling sites with one camera-trap each. Estimated density was 21 ± 3 individuals km–2 and estimated population size was 4935 ± 368 individuals. Occupancy increases with palm density, distance from forest edge, and canopy cover. Occupancy and detectability decreases with distance from water resources. Detectability increases with palm density. The results presented herein can be a starting point to support future action plans for the species, making predictions regarding the ecosystem and management and conservation of D. leporina.},

Using a camera-trap design (85 stations, 8,825 camera days, 317 km2), we recorded a total of 33 mammalian species during the dry season of 2016. Species-specific effects of environmental covariates based on multi-species occupancy modeling showed that only elevation had a statistically significant effect on occupancy. Also, a principal coordinate analysis and a distance-based redundancy analysis suggested that the variation in species composition is mainly explained by elevation, and moderately by both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the distance to roads. The highlands appear to be dominated by a reduced assembly of species consisting of the montane guinea pig, the Andean fox, and the northern pudu. Functional diversity decreased with elevation, providing evidence that lowland and highland communities are functionally dissimilar. Moreover, land-use is changing rapidly in the areas surrounding the TNNS, suggesting that increased connectivity at the two extremes of the elevational gradient (the highlands and the lowlands) will ensure the long-term viability of terrestrial mammalian populations and, thus, the ecological processes in which they are involved.},

Jaguar density was evaluated in an ESA of 156 km2, using ‘Capture–Recapture’ (C-R) and ‘Spatially Explicit Capture–Recapture’ (SECR) models. We obtained 28 photographic captures of two females, in which models averaged a density of 1.01 ± 0.41 ind/100 km2. The mid and large size-mammal community included 14 species with forested landscape and vegetation measured at 90\%. The scientific literature includes 30 jaguar density estimates in Mexico, with 22 (85\%) inside Protected Areas. Average density among all estimates in México is 2.85 ± 1.82 STD. For the first time, our density estimates provide reliable population-level data for one key region for jaguar conservation efforts in the northern hemisphere. As low-density estimates were obtained, this population is highly vulnerable, deserving priority attention by conservation strategies at a national level.RESUMENEl jaguar está en peligro de extinción en México.

Abandoned dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis silvestris catus) pose conservation challenges for Chilean wildlife including the pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo) and the güiña (Leopardus guigna). We used camera trap data to investigate influences of natural and anthropogenic landscape features on spatiotemporal trends of these species. We also used co-occurrence modeling and kernel density estimation to investigate spatial and temporal patterns overlap of wildcats, free-ranging (FR) dogs, and FR-cats. FR-dogs showed the highest detection and site use probabilities, while güiñas had the lowest across 80 camera trap sites. Top models showed no spatial avoidance between species and co-occurrence of wildcats was positively influenced by forest habitat. However, FR-dogs negatively affected detection of wildcats. Ravines surrounded by forest positively influenced güiña and pampas cat detection probabilities when dominant species were not present. FR-dogs and wildcats had significantly different temporal activity patterns and low overlap coefficients, while wildcats and FR-cats showed high overlap in activity patterns. We suggest changing current policies to control domestic animals and strategic planning in agricultural areas of central Chile to better conserve native wildcat species.},

The Brazilian Atlantic forest is considered a biodiversity hotspot and although highly fragmented, it still contains large forest patches that may be important for the conservation of mammals that require large areas. Here, we estimated species richness, density and biomass of medium- and large-sized mammals along the largest remnant of the Atlantic rainforest, Brazil (the Serra do Mar bioregion), an estimated area of 8000 km2. We recorded 44 species based on 4090 km of diurnal line transects and camera traps, animal tracks and interviews in 11 continental regions and two large land-bridge islands. We found high levels of similarity in mammalian composition between pairs of sites in the continental forest sites (0.84–1), but much lower similarity between pairs from the continental forest sites and the two large land-bridge islands (0.29–0.74) indicating potential local extinctions or poor dispersal of continental mammals to these islands. In addition, we found that the density and biomass varied 16- and 70-fold among sites, respectively. Mammalian biomass declined by up to 98\% in intensively hunted sites and was 53-fold lower than in other Neotropical non-fragmented forests. Although this large forest remnant is able to maintain a high diversity of medium- and large-bodied mammal species, their low density and biomass may affect the long-term persistence of these populations and the ecosystem services they provide.},

	abstract = {To protect and manage an intact neotropical carnivore guild, it is necessary to understand the relative importance of habitat selection and intraguild competition to the ecology of individual species. This study examined habitat use of four carnivores in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve, Belize. We calculated photographic trap success (TS) rates for jaguars Panthera onca, pumas Puma concolor, ocelots Leopardus pardalis, grey foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus, potential prey and humans at 47 remote camera stations spaced along roads and trails within the 139 km2 study site. At each station, we used manual habitat sampling in combination with geographic information systems to estimate habitat characteristics pertaining to vegetation cover. We used negative binomial models to analyse species-specific TS as a response to habitat (including vegetation and landscape variables, prey activity and human activity) and co-predator activity rates. Jaguars [TS=7.56±1.279 (se) captures per 100 trap-nights (TN)] and grey foxes (31.5±6.073 captures per 100 TN) were commonly captured by cameras, while pumas (0.66±0.200 captures per 100 TN) and ocelots (0.55±0.209 captures per 100 TN) were rare. Model selection via Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that models including habitat variables generally performed better than models including co-predator activity. Felid captures were positively associated with small bird TS and with the width or length of surrounding roads, while fox counts showed few habitat associations. Ocelot activity was positively related to jaguar captures, an effect probably explained by their shared preference for areas with more roads. Pumas were negatively related to human activity and jaguars showed a similar, though non-significant, trend, suggesting that these felids may be sensitive to human disturbance even within protected areas. Results suggest that these predators do not spatially partition habitat and that the jaguar could function as an umbrella species for smaller sympatric carnivores.},

However, activity patterns of most Neotropical species are still poorly understood. Based on an 8-year camera-trapping survey conducted between 2009 and 2017, we evaluated puma (Puma concolor) activity patterns in a human-modified landscape in Southeastern Brazil. Our objectives were to determine the activity pattern of pumas and to verify the influence of main prey species and anthropogenic factors on their behavior. We categorized activity patterns of all assessed species based on the proportion of independent records during night and day times. We tested for sex differences in activity patterns of pumas, and measured their overlap with most consumed prey, people, cattle and domestic dogs. Our results suggested that males engaged in mostly nocturnal behavior while females were active both at night and day hours. Pumas exhibited higher coefficient of overlapping with prey species that were most often included in their diet, suggesting that prey availability might influence puma activity or that pumas opportunistically prey upon species with similar activity pattern. Female pumas seem to be more exposed to anthropogenic threats due to higher activity pattern overlap with people and domestic dogs. Our findings provide insights into puma-prey temporal behavior, highlighting the relevance of intrasexual dissimilarity in the activity patterns of a top predator living in a disturbed landscape.},

	abstract = {Camera traps (CTs) have been increasingly used for wildlife monitoring worldwide. In the tropics, most CT inventories target wildlife-friendly sites, and CTs are commonly placed towards wildlife trails. However, it has been argued that this placement strategy potentially provides biased results in comparison to more systematic or randomized approaches. Here, we investigated the impact of CT placement on the remotely sensed mammal diversity in a tropical forest in Gabon by comparing pairs of systematically placed and wildlife-trail-oriented CTs. Our survey protocol consisted of 15–17 sampling points arranged on a 2 km2 grid and left for one month in the field. This protocol was replicated sequentially in four areas. Each sampling point comprised a CT pair: the ‘systematic CT’, installed at the theoretical point and systematically oriented towards the most uncluttered view; and the ‘trail CT’, placed within a 20-m radius and facing a wildlife trail. For the vast majority of species, the detection probabilities were comparable between placements. Species average capture rates were slightly higher for trail-based CTs, though this trend was not significant for any species. Therefore, the species richness and composition of the overall community, such as the spatial distribution patterns (from evenly spread to site-restricted) of individual species, were similarly depicted by both placements. Opting for a systematic orientation ensures that pathways used preferentially by some species—and avoided by others—will be sampled proportionally to their density in the forest undergrowth. However, trail-based placement is routinely used, already producing standardised data within large-scale monitoring programmes. Here, both placements provided a comparable picture of the mammal community, though it might not be necessarily true in depauperate areas. Both types of CT data can nevertheless be combined in multi-site analyses, since methods now allow accounting for differences in study design and detection bias in original CT data.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest ungulates are poorly known and, despite their ecological and conservation significance, there are few studies on their density and abundance. I estimated densities of lesser oriental chevrotain Tragulus kanchil in the Southern Cardamom National Park, south-west Cambodia using camera-trap encounter rates and fitting a random encounter model (REM) that does not require individual identification of animals. This represents the first use of REM on forest ungulates in mainland tropical Asia and provides the first density estimate for any chevrotain species in mainland South East Asia. Sixty-five camera-trap stations generated 501 encounters of lesser oriental chevrotain across {\textgreater}8200 camera-trap nights within a systematic random camera-trap grid of 200 km2 in the Southern Cardamom National Park. Density of lesser oriental chevrotain was estimated at between 57 and 98 ( 81) individuals per km2. The random deployment of camera-traps, a prerequisite of the REM, did not prevent the detection of the majority of ground-dwelling large mammal species likely to be present in the study site. Despite its slow uptake by field conservationists, the REM may have potential for monitoring tropical ungulates particularly in dense evergreen forest where other methodologies, for example, distance-based line transect sampling are unsuitable.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a primary driver of wildlife loss, and establishment of biological corridors is a common strategy to mitigate this problem. A flagship example is the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), which aims to connect protected forest areas between Mexico and Panama to allow dispersal and gene flow of forest organisms. Because forests across Central America have continued to degrade, the functioning of the MBC has been questioned, but reliable estimates of species occurrence were unavailable. Large mammals are suitable indicators of forest functioning, so we assessed their conservation status across the Isthmus of Panama, the narrowest section of the MBC. We used large-scale camera-trap surveys and hierarchical multispecies occupancy models in a Bayesian framework to estimate the occupancy of 9 medium to large mammals and developed an occupancy-weighted connectivity metric to evaluate species-specific functional connectivity. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), jaguar (Panthera onca), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and tapir (Tapirus bairdii) had low expected occupancy along the MBC in Panama. Puma (Puma concolor), red brocket deer (Mazama temama), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), which are more adaptable, had higher occupancy, even in areas with low forest cover near infrastructure. However, the majority of species were subject to ≥1 gap that was larger than their known dispersal distances, suggesting poor connectivity along the MBC in Panama. Based on our results, forests in Darien, Donoso–Santa Fe, and La Amistad International Park are critical for survival of large terrestrial mammals in Panama and 2 areas need restoration.},

	abstract = {The Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica have been severely changed by humans over the past several decades and now consist of a patchwork of habitats, much of which is a “human dominated” landscape which has altered the region’s animal community. To improve our understanding of how terrestrial mammals are utilizing human-dominated tropical habitats, we distributed camera traps across the five main different habitat types (old-growth forest, young secondary forest, oil palm plantation, riparian strip forest, and pastures; N =50 camera traps per habitat) of our 80 km2 large study area (part of the biological corridor COBIGA) located in the lowlands of the Golfo Dulce Bioregion in southwestern Costa Rica. Species accumulation curves indicate that young secondary forests had the highest species diversity of ground-dwelling mammals while pastures had the lowest. However, the composition of mammal assemblages recorded at individual sites did not differ significantly between habitat types. But, when pooling sites on the level of habitats and using the species’ incidences, a cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis similarities, indicate two distinct clusters: one cluster containing the three forest types and a second cluster with the two land-use systems, pastures and oil palm plantations. Additionally, these land-use systems were more heavily utilized at night, while mammal activity proved being relatively higher in forest habitats during the day. A model selection approach was used to evaluate the importance of different habitat structures for the occurrence of the two most abundant mammal species, Northern Raccoon and Central American Agouti, by considering different spatial scales (50m, 100m, and 200m buffers around camera locations). The presence of roads had the largest negative influence on the presence of Northern Raccoons at the 50m buffer and the 100m buffer. Settlements and gardens had the most positive effect at 50m and at 100m. Further, the Northern Raccoon appeared to avoid old-growth forest. While at all other habitats the species was recorded at 30-43 \% of the camera trap sites, it was found only at 10\% of the old-growth forest sites. The occurrence of Central American Agouti was positively related to the presence of water bodies (at all buffers) and old growth forests (at 100 and 200m). Habitat preferences of mammals in our study area proved being very diverse. Some mammals prefer natural forest setting and others do not show an affinity for any specific habitat. Perhaps the relatively high density of riparian forest strips, the protection of remaining secondary forest patches and the implementation of reforestation measures are substantially contributing to improving landscape permeability for forest specialist and generalists and, hence, are facilitating the relatively high mammal diversity within the human-dominated countryside. Future studies should assess spatial movements of animals to identify the true importance of individual habitat structures for mammals, an important precondition for improving the effectiveness of biological corridors.},

We performed a new inventory of the medium and large-sized mammals in the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, southeastern Brazil. Our assessment was based on a new camera-trapping sampling design that incorporates a one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to characterize environmental heterogeneity across the study area. We selected sampling locations in different microhabitats to conduct a 90-day camera trap monitoring. Our sampling effort was 28,704 hours, resulting in 755 photographic records, from which we identified 15 native medium and large-sized mammals, one small-sized mammal (Guerlinguetus brasiliensis), and one exotic species (Canis familiaris). The native mammals included four species not listed in the last inventory carried out in the study area: Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo), Tamandua tetradactyla (collared anteater), Herpailurus yagouaroundi (jaguarundi), and Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox). This outcome may indicate the efficiency of our sampling design, which represents an innovative approach to characterizing local mammal communities across an environmental gradient, ensuring broad representation of different resources and habitat characteristics. Consequently, our approach may ensure the recording of the local mammal assemblage and is an appropriate option for inventorying and monitoring medium to large-sized mammals.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and degradation is threatening mammals worldwide. Therefore, Protected Areas (PA) are of utmost importance to preserve biodiversity. Their effectiveness, however, depends on some management strategies such as buffer zones, which prevent/mitigate the impact of external threats and might increase the amount of available habitat for wildlife existing within reserves. Nevertheless, how intensively terrestrial mammals use buffer zones remains little studied, particularly in the Neotropical region. Aiming to analyse the use of a buffer zone (5 km wide) by medium and large-sized mammals, we modelled the occupancy probabilities of five species of conservation concern including local (interior and buffer zone) as a site covariate, simultaneously controlling for imperfect detection. Data collection was made with camera traps from April to September 2013 in a 9000 ha Cerrado PA (“interior”) and in its surrounding area (39721.41 ha; “buffer zone”). This PA (Jataí Ecological Station) is immersed in a landscape where sugarcane plantations predominate in the northeastern of the state of São Paulo. We also conducted an inventory to compare the number and composition of species between interior and buffer zone. A total of 31 mammal species (26 natives) was recorded via camera traps and active search for sightings, vocalizations, tracks and signs. Occupancy estimates for Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Leopardus pardalis and Pecari tajacu were numerically higher in interior. On the other hand, Chrysocyon brachyurus had the highest occupancy in buffer zone, while the largest predator, Puma concolor, used both areas similarly. However, as the confidence intervals (95\%) overlapped, the differences in occupancy probabilities between interior and buffer were weak for all these species. Additionally, regarding only the species recorded by cameras, the observed and estimated richness were similar between interior and buffer zone of the PA. Our data demonstrated that the buffer zone is indeed used by medium and large-sized mammals, including conservation-dependent ones. The lack of enforcement of current legislation regarding buffer zones is therefore a real threat for mammals, even when protection is guaranteed in the interior of protected areas.},

We present the first camera-trap study of the mammal community of the Cerros del Sira.

Eight are listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List, three are categorized as Data Deficient and one is yet to be assessed. Although other authors have reported that the upper elevations of the Cerros del Sira are free from hunting, we found evidence of hunting activity occurring above 1,400 m, and inside the core protected area. In addition to this direct evidence of hunting, recent information has identified significant amounts of canopy loss in the northern reaches of the core zone. Despite widespread ecological degradation in the surrounding lowlands, the high-elevation areas of the Cerros del Sira still maintain a unique assemblage of lowland and highland tropical rainforest mammals. It has been assumed that the Cerros del Sira and other similar remote locations are safe from disturbance and protected by their isolation but we suggest this is an increasingly dangerous assumption to make, and secure protection strategies need to be developed.},

The Network for Protection and Conservation of Amolar Mountain Ridge is an informal initiative that legally protects over 2000 km2 of the Pantanal biome. Several camera-trapping surveys were carried out at Amolar Mountain Ridge from
August 2011 to September 2013 in order to increase our knowledge of the species occurrence and its ecological requirements. The aims of this study were : 1) to inventory the carnivore species occurring within this network of protected areas; 2) to describe their activity patterns and 3) to discuss threats for those species’ conservation in the region. We used the Kernel density method to describe the species’ activity patterns. We obtained 764 records (from 12703 camera-days) of eight carnivores, including endangered species in Brazil, such as the jaguar
(Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), that were among the most frequently recorded by camera traps. The other species detected were the South America coati (Nasua nasua), the tayra (Eira barbara), the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) and the jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). We
provided information on activity patterns of the jaguar and puma, which exhibited cathemeral activity patterns, on the ocelot and crab-eating fox, which were mostly nocturnal, and on the Southern coati and jaguarundi, which were diurnal. Scansorial and species that occur naturally in low densities as the tayra and the crab-eating raccoon
were difficult to be detected with the used camera trapping setting. However, due to the natural characteristics of the study area, camera trapping is among the most appropriate tools for providing data about carnivores and their prey. This information is essential to delineate conservation plans for Amolar Mountain Ridge.},

	abstract = {Temporal niche shifts can shape predator–prey interactions by enabling predator avoidance, enhancing feeding success, and reducing competition among predators. Using a community-based conservation approach, we investigated temporal niche partitioning of mammalian predators and prey across 12 long-term camera trap surveys in the Pacific slope and Talamanca Cordillera of Costa Rica. Temporal overlap and segregation were investigated between predator–prey and predator–predator pairs using overlap analysis, circular statistics, and relative abundance after accounting for differences in habitat, season, and human impact among sites. We made the assumption that predators select abundant prey and adjust their activity to maximize their temporal overlap, thus we predicted that abundant prey with high overlap would be preferred prey species for that predator. We also predicted that similar-sized pairs of predator species with the greatest potential for competitive interactions would have the highest temporal segregation. Our results supported the existence of temporal niche separation among the eight species of predators—the smaller Leopardus felids (ocelot, margay, oncilla) were primarily nocturnal, the largest felids (jaguar and puma) and coyote were cathemeral, and the smaller jaguarundi and tayra were mostly diurnal. Most prey species (67\%) were primarily nocturnal versus diurnal or cathemeral (33\%). Hierarchical clustering identified relationships among species with the most similar activity patterns. We discuss the primary prey and competitor species predicted for each of the eight predators. Contrary to our prediction, the activity pattern of similar-sized intraguild competitors overlapped more than dissimilar-sized competitors, suggesting that similar-sized predators are hunting the same prey at the same time. From this we conclude that prey availability is more important than competition in determining circadian activity patterns of Neotropical predators. Our results indicate the presence of a delicate balance of tropical food webs that may be disrupted by overhunting, leading to a depauperate community consisting of ubiquitous generalists and endangered specialists. With Central America a hotspot for hunting-induced “empty forests,” community-based conservation approaches may offer the best road to reduce illegal hunting and maintain the biodiversity and community structure of tropical forest systems.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Rapid assessments are the most common information source on biodiversity in the northwestern Amazon in Colombia due to limited resources and logistic constraints. These assessments are essential for decision-making on environmental policies in this region, that has been strongly impacted by the transformation of its natural ecosystems. Several local camera-trapping rapid assessments of medium and large-sized mammals (MLM) have been conducted in the Colombian Amazon, but they are difficult to compare. We analyzed information of 16 of these rapid assessments of MLM to provide the first list of MLM in the northwestern Amazon in Colombia. We also evaluated the accuracy of four estimators (ICE, Chao-2, Jackknife-1, and Jackknife-2), and the minimum sampling effort for the estimation of MLM richness in local surveys in the region. We report 26 species of MLM for the Colombian Amazon (between five and 13 species per locality), which is an underestimation of MLM richness in the region. The best estimator of MLM richness was the Jackknife-1, due to its precision and the lower influence of singletons. We recommend a minimum sampling effort of 350 camera trap-days. Although rapid assessments do not allow a robust estimation of MLM richness, they record the most common species (or core species) per locality and their abundance variation. The evaluation of the effect of habitat transformation on MLM and the estimation of population parameters of rare species require more intensive studies.},

We set 28 camera traps along the 54km stretch of the highway covering wildlife underpasses (10), and culverts such as box culverts (9) and pipes (9) from September 2016 until March 2017. A total of 24 jaguar crossings have been recorded exclusively using wildlife underpasses, including four males and two females. At least 18 other mammal species including five of the target priority species (protected by Mexican law) were documented, all of which were native except for two invasive species. In terms of species using the crossing structures, we identified 13 species using wildlife underpasses, nine using concrete box culverts and 10 using concrete pipes. Wildlife underpasses show higher diversity values (Shannon´s exponential index = 5.8 and Inverse Simpson´s index = 4.66) compared to culverts because they allow bigger species to cross. We recommend more highways along the jaguar´s distribution should develop mitigation measures to allow for wildlife connectivity. Wildlife underpasses, along with retrofitted culverts, could help secure not only the permanence of this species by facilitating the functional connectivity between populations but have positive impacts on other neotropical mammalian fauna as well.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.25903/5be8adb35232e},
	abstract = {Rising demand for products derived from oil palm has resulted in accelerated expansion of its global cropping area. In Southeast Asia, where most of world's oil palm is produced, forest loss due to oil palm cultivation has become one of the major threats to biodiversity. As reviewed in Chapter 1, oil palm is now rapidly expanding in Latin America, where Colombia is the largest oil palm producer with nearly 500,000 ha currently under cultivation. Although most oil palm expansion in Colombia has taken place on partially degraded lands or in areas previously used for crops or livestock, little is known about the biodiversity that currently exists in these landscapes and the effect that expanded oil palm agriculture will have. Because Colombia is one of the world's most biodiverse countries, understanding how oil palm production affects wildlife communities is vital to inform conservation planning and improve land-management practices.

In this thesis, I used mammal species as a focal group to evaluate how fauna have responded to expanding oil palm production in Colombia. Mammals are a diverse group and, as such, are good indicators of ecosystem degradation. This is because mammals occupy a wide range of ecological niches, have important and varied roles at a range of different trophic levels, and are often vulnerable to habitat fragmentation.

I conducted this study in the rural areas surrounding the towns of Restrepo, Cumaral, Cabuyaro, Acacias, Castilla la Nueva, and San Carlos de Guaroa, in the Department of Meta, in the eastern plains or Llanos Orientales region of Colombia. This region, which has become the largest oil palm-production zone in the country, is a seminatural savanna ecosystem interspersed by riparian forests of differing sizes and ages along rivers and streams and human land uses such as grazing and agriculture. Within this study area, I used unbaited, automatic camera traps at 56 sites located each at least 2 km apart (33 sites in oil palm plantations and 23 in riparian forest), spanning a total area of {\textasciitilde}2,000 km² (194‒394 m.a.s.l.) to detect terrestrial medium- and large-sized mammals ({\textgreater}0.5 kg). In the Llanos region, knowledge of the ecology and distribution of most terrestrial mammals is very limited. Therefore, I used multiple approaches (as described below) to address these gaps and understand the responses of mammals to oil palm plantations and other local- and landscapelevel environmental factors in the Colombian Llanos.

First, in Chapter 2, I examined how species richness, abundance and composition of terrestrial mammal species differed between oil palm plantations and riparian forests. I also determined the influence of landscape- and habitat-level features on those metrics. Data from 12,403 camera-days revealed that species richness and the community-level composition of mammals differed significantly between oil palm and riparian forest, with site-level richness in oil palm plantations being 47\% lower, on average, than in riparian forests. Within plantations, mammalian species richness was strongly and negatively correlated with the abundance of cattle, and positively correlated with the density of undergrowth vegetation.

Across the study area, the community composition of mammals at each camera-trap site was significantly influenced by cover type (oil palm versus riparian forest), the percentage of forest remaining, and the distance to the nearest town. Within oil palm sites, understory vegetation, cattle abundance, and canopy cover had significant effects on community composition. Species-specific responses varied between habitat types, with oil palm having positive effects on the abundance of medium-sized omnivore/carnivores, insectivores and grazers such as jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), fox (Cerdocyon thous), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus cariacou). My findings suggest that increasing habitat complexity and retaining native riparian forest – regardless of its physiognomic structure – in oil palm-dominated landscapes will help to support higher native mammal richness and abundance at both local and landscape scales.

Second, building on the above findings and in preparation for the imminent expansion of oil palm production in Colombia, I aimed to identify critical transition points (thresholds) in land cover change at which mammal communities drastically change. Identifying thresholds is especially crucial to anticipate sustainable oil palm-cover limits for conservation planning. Therefore, in Chapter 3, I investigated the possible existence of change points for terrestrial mammal richness and community composition along an increasing gradient of oil palm cover in the study area, which covered approximately 2,000 km². At each camera-trap site, I found a negative linear relationship between the proportion of oil palm and species richness, but no evidence for significant threshold effects on richness per se. In contrast, I found strong signs of a threshold change in mammal community composition when oil palm cover in the zone immediately surrounding the camera-trap reached 45-75\%, beyond which mammalian species community composition drastically changed. Moreover, when species were assessed individually, a significant threshold response to oil palm land cover was found to occur in 10 of 15 species, with four [squirrel (Sciurus spp), agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa), spiny rat (Proechimis spp), common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis)] having a negative threshold at approximately 45\% oil palm cover. The other five species showed no evidence of any critical transition point [giant anteater, lesser anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), jaguarondi, white-tailed deer and crap-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus)].

These findings contribute to the identification of the maximum oil palm cover allowable within production zones in Colombia to ensure the conservation of terrestrial mammals. I then used the 45-75\% oil palm-cover threshold I identified to examine the conservation status of oil palm production zones across all of Colombia (North, South, West and East zones). For this assessment, I first delimited the spatial extend of each of these zones using the farthest plantations as the limit, as there is no official delimitation for each zone. Then, I used the community threshold identified above as a baseline and determined the percentage of oil palm at each production zone relative to that threshold in relation to the extent of these zones within a fishnet composed of 1 km² squares, constructed to cover the size of each production zone. I found that 41\% of the {\textasciitilde}340,000 ha total area covered by these four zones had already crossed the 45-75\% threshold. This result suggests a need for urgent restoration of native forest to increase its extent in these zones if a potential collapse of mammal communities is to be avoided. The identified threshold for oil palm coverage can be used as a guideline to anticipate the minimum amount of remaining native forest needed to support resilient populations of mammals. As such, my results also suggest that maintaining a minimum forest cover of 25-55\% in Llanos oil palm-dominated landscapes will help to promote mammal conservation—avoiding a 'risk zone' of drastic population declines.

Third, while the positive conservation role of remaining natural habitats in anthropogenic landscapes is relatively clear, quantifying the degree to which the agricultural matrix imposes limitations on animal use and movements is vital to understand species' resilience to land-use change. In Chapter 4, I evaluated the habitat use and detection probabilities of 23 medium- and large-sized mammals in oil palm plantations and adjacent riparian forest in the Llanos region, using an occupancy framework. I also assessed the effect of undergrowth vegetation and proximity to forest on habitat-use probability within oil palm sites. Most species were detected only rarely, limiting the analysis to the 12 most common species found in both habitat types. This issue was particularly evident in oil palm, because seven species found in riparian forests were never detected there. Habitat use (Ψ{\textasciicircum}) was strongly influenced by habitat type for four species, showing a strong negative effect of oil palm, whereas the remaining eight species showed no effect of habitat type.

As expected, probabilities of oil palm and forest use varied somewhat among species. In general, omnivorous mesocarnivores, white-tailed deer, and the giant anteater were more likely to use oil palm whereas the remaining species, including ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and lesser anteaters, showed a preference for forest habitats. In general, my findings suggest that retaining undergrowth vegetation inside plantations and maintaining nearby riparian corridors will reduce the negative impacts that a homogenous monoculture, such as an oil palm plantation, exerts on native mammal species. One caveat of this study is that historical land uses have varied across the Llanos region, potentially complicating the patterns I detected.

The ability of some animal species to adjust their behaviour in response to landscape changes and human presence may allow them to better adapt to new, human-altered conditions. However, behavioral responses to land-use change by mammal species are not well documented. In Chapter 5, I quantified the activity patterns of several terrestrial mammal species to investigate how this aspect of animal behaviour differs between oil palm plantations and riparian forests. I also evaluated the effect of human activity on the activity patterns of mammal species and examined temporal overlap of activity between species to investigate potential species interactions. I used 2,515 camera trap records of 23 mammal species from 12,403 camera days, and analyzed the data using Kernel density estimation and the coefficient of temporal overlap (Δ). Data were sufficient to assess the activity patterns of 10 species in riparian forest and seven species in oil palm plantations. Of these, four species [capybara (Hydrochaerus hydrochaeris), giant anteater, lesser anteater and common opossum] were represented by enough records (n {\textgreater} 20) in both oil palm and forest to allow for robust comparisons. Only capybaras showed a shift in activity patterns, changing from being crepuscular in the forest to predominantly nocturnal in oil palm plantations. Regarding the effect of humans on the activity patterns of mammals, capybaras, giant anteaters and white-tailed deer appeared to modify their activities to avoid human activities in oil palm plantations by becoming more crepuscular or nocturnal. This was not true of jaguarondi, which displayed activity levels that strongly overlapped temporally with human activities.

Pair-wise analyses suggested that temporal segregation occurred between some species occupying the same trophic position (e.g. fox and jaguarundi) within oil palm plantations, whereas conversely some predators and their prey (e.g. ocelot and armadillo [Dasypus novemcinctus]) had high overlaps in temporal activity patterns in riparian forest. My findings shed light on how the conversion of native forest to oil palm plantation can lead to behavioral changes of wildlife, a feature of the effect of anthropogenic land use change that is not frequently assessed.

This thesis is the most comprehensive analysis to date examining the effects of oil palm plantations on Colombian terrestrial mammals. Overall, my findings help document mammal diversity in oil palm-dominated landscapes in Colombia and improve understanding of the complex ecological relationships among mammal species in these landscapes. Importantly, oil palm plantations were unsuitable habitat for most native species. The environmental conditions and the history of oil palm development in the Colombian Llanos is dissimilar to that of Southeast Asia. Therefore, we cannot rely on information and recommendations from studies in that region to evaluate the South American context. We must consider the geographical and environmental particularities and land-use history of each geographic area when evaluating impacts of oil palm production on Colombia's biodiversity. As such, the conclusions and recommendations contained in this thesis provide valuable information from which to develop more effective management practices to retain native mammals in Colombian oil palm landscapes.},

					 Medium and large mammals ({\textgreater} 1 kg) were studied using camera traps with active sensors in a Conservation Unit located in an area of Mixed Rain Forest or Araucaria Forest (Atlantic Forest at altitude) in the South of Brazil, as a method for investigating the area’s conservation status and enabling comparison with other types of environments in which these mammals occur in the Neotropical region. From June 2005 to December 2010, a sampling effort of 10,844 trap-days yielded records of 21 species. A minimum sampling effort of 3000 trap-days was necessary to obtain records of all of these species. The species with the greatest frequency of photocaptures was Dasyprocta azarae (agouti), followed by Leopardus pardalis (ocelot), Leopardus guttulus (southern oncilla or little spotted cat) and Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo). The species with the lowest numbers of records were Pecari tajacu (collared peccary) and Chrysocyon brachyurus (maned wolf). Although the Conservation Unit studied has small physical dimensions, the diversity of species of medium and large mammals was comparable with what has been observed in other types of forests, in particular because there are still effective biological corridors in the area.},

Although the problem is widespread and increasing, there are few studies on Neotropical forests. Here we quantify the occurrence of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in an Atlantic forest reserve in south-eastern Brazil (Santa Lúcia Biological Station - SLBS). Throughout two years of monitoring with camera traps (2,142 camera-days), 25 records of 16 individual dogs were obtained in the interior of SLBS, making dogs the fourth most frequently recorded species of mammals in general and the first-ranking among Carnivora, ahead of the ocelot and puma, the top two terrestrial predators present in SLBS. Dogs entered the forest year round, in almost half of the sampled months (48\%), and predominantly during daytime (89\%). They were detected in various trails inside the reserve, but mostly in areas nearest to the reserve's border ({\textless}200 m from the edge). Record rates of domestic dogs did not correlate significantly with climate variables, with frequency of mammal records and richness in general, or with any particular mammal species (Spearman rank correlation, p {\textgreater} 0.05 in all cases), suggesting an erratic, non-seasonal pattern of entrance in the reserve. Data indicate that domestic dogs can be abundant and frequent visitors to little disturbed Atlantic forest reserves even when these are located in regions of low density of human population.

	abstract = {Innovative techniques, such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, are now promoting broader biodiversity monitoring at unprecedented scales, because of the reduction in time, presumably lower cost, and methodological efficiency. Our goal was to assess the efficiency of established inventory techniques (live-trapping grids, pitfall traps, camera trapping, mist netting) as well as eDNA for detecting Amazonian mammals. For terrestrial small mammals, we used 32 live-trapping grids based on Sherman and Tomahawk traps (total effort of 10,368 trap-nights); in addition to 16 pitfall traps (1,408 trap-nights). For bats, we used mist nets at 8 sites (4,800 net hours). For medium and large mammals, we used 72 camera trap stations (5,208 camera-days). We identified vertebrate and mammal taxa based on eDNA analysis (12S region, with V05 and Mamm01 markers) from water samples, including a total of 11 3-km transects for stagnant water sampling and seven small streams for running water sampling. A total of 106 mammal species were recorded. Building on sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves, both trapping grids and pitfall were successful, recording 91.16\% and 82.1\% of the expected species for these techniques ( 22 and 9 species), and 16.98\% and 6.60\% of the total recorded mammal species, respectively. Mist nets recorded 83.2\% of the expected bat species ( 48), and 34.91\% of the total recorded species. Camera trapping recorded 99.2\% of the predicted large- and medium-sized species ( 31), and 33.02\% of the total recorded species. eDNA recorded 75.4\% of the expected mammal species for this technique ( 68), and 47.0\% of the total recorded species. eDNA resulted in a useful tool that saves on effort and reduces sampling costs. This study is among the first to show the large potential of eDNA metabarcoding for assessing Amazonian mammal communities, providing, in combination with conventional techniques, a rapid overview of mammal diversity with broad applications to monitoring, management and conservation. By including appropriate genetic markers and updated reference databases, eDNA metabarcoding method can be extended to the whole vertebrate community.},

Using a participatory approach, we deployed the largest camera-trap network in Mesoamerica to date to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance shapes the occupancy and co-occurrence of terrestrial vertebrate species in a tropical biodiversity hotspot: the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. We estimated species richness in different categories of land protection with rarefaction analysis and estimated the expected occupancy with a joint species distribution model that included covariates for anthropogenic disturbance, land protection, habitat quality, and habitat availability. Areas with the most stringent land-use protections (e.g., Corcovado National Park, 24 species [95\% CI 23–25]) harbored significantly more species than unprotected areas (20 species [19.7–20.3]), mainly due to a reduced presence of large-bodied species of conservation concern in unprotected areas (e.g., jaguar Panthera onca and white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari). Small-bodied generalist species, such as opossums (Didelphidae) and armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), in contrast, were more common at disturbed sites, resulting in a significant difference in vertebrate community composition between sites with low and high disturbance. Co-occurrence of species was also mainly associated with response to disturbance. Similar responses to disturbance create two groups of species, those whose site-level occupancy usually increased as anthropogenic disturbance increased and those whose estimated occupancy decreased. The absence of large-bodied species entails an important loss of ecological function in disturbed areas and can hinder forest development and maintenance. Efforts to protect and restore forested landscapes are likely having a positive effect on the abundance of some threatened species. These efforts, however, must be sustained and expanded to increase connectivity and ensure the long-term viability of the wildlife community.},

	abstract = {In Amazonian igapó forests (seasonally flooded forests on blackwater river margins), the end of the annual flood pulse results in the formation of extensive mat-like seed patches. The seeds in these patches then germinate, forming a dense, highly heterogeneous, assemblage. Animal–plant interactions in these areas, as well as the influence that the patches have on the occurrence of herbivorous vertebrates, remain almost completely unstudied. Using camera traps in areas with and without seed/seedling patches, we tested the relationship between these seed accumulation sites and the presence of bird and mammal species. At the micro-scale (between treatments), vertebrate occurrence was not related to patch presence. At the larger scale (local), distance from adjacent upland (terra firme) forest and seed patch size were correlated with vertebrate distribution. The widespread occurrence of terrestrially active birds and mammals throughout igapó forests, not just where food resource densities were high, seems to be a compromise strategy between exploring the area to select the most favourable food items, and minimizing the risk of being predated when spending extended time foraging at the concentrated food sources represented by the seed patches. Our results underline the potential importance of igapó forests as a key habitat for a variety of terrestrial terra firme taxa, as well as emphasize the dynamic nature of this forest type, and should encourage further studies of this habitat and resource availability system.},

For terrestrial habitats, camera traps are used as a common technique to record mammals and other vertebrates and have been recently utilized to observe arboreal animals as well. Here, we compare the difference in mammal diversity between floor and canopy strata and evaluate the use of camera trapping in a lowland forest in central Amazon. We installed nine paired camera traps, one in the canopy stratum and other in the floor stratum, in the Alto Cuieiras Biological Reserve (Brazilian Amazon). With a sampling effort of 720 camera-days, we recorded 30 mammal species: nine in canopy strata, 14 in floor strata, and seven in scansorial strata (sharing both strata). On the forest floor, the species with the greatest abundance was Myoprocta acouchy; in the canopy, Isothrix paguros had the greatest abundance; and among the scansorial species, Proechymis sp. was the most abundant. Our results show the differences in mammal diversity between floor and canopy strata; canopy strata contained more small and frugivorous mammals. Although we obtained a relatively low sampling effort with the camera-trap method compared with other studies utilizing different techniques, our results were especially similar to those of previous studies that worked with canopy and floor strata. Thus, camera trap can be very effective for recording short periods of time, and this method is less physically exhaustive and expensive for researchers to study vertical strata.},

Despite the lack of knowledge on mammalian species occurrence, several mining companies established in this region has rapidly changed its landscape. Therefore, this study aims to carry out an inventory of medium- to large-sized mammals in the UM to estimate their relative abundance and activity patterns using data provided by camera trapping surveys. Two main camera-trapping surveys were carried between October 2014 and July 2015, in addition to a small survey in July 2016. Results showed 25 species from medium- to large-sized mammals. Dicotyles tajacu, Dasyprocta azarae and Dasypus novemcinctus presented the highest relative abundance indices. Overall, D. azarae, Nasua nasua and Euphractus sexcinctus were diurnal, while Tamandua tetradactyla, D. novemcinctus, Tapirus terrestris and Sylvilagus paraguensis were nocturnal, in turn, D. tajacu and Cerdocyon thous were associated with the crepuscular period. Overall, 28 \% (N = 7) and 12 \% (N = 3) of the recorded species are threatened nationally and globally, respectively. Due to the scarcity of protected areas in the UM, we recommend long term monitoring of mammals and ecological studies to support conservation actions for this group in the region},

We investigated how forest mammals respond to a landscape mosaic, including mature oil palm plantations and primary forest patches in Eastern Amazonia. Using both line-transect censuses (LTC) and camera-trapping (CT), we quantified the general patterns of mammal community structure and attempted to identify both species life-history traits and the environmental and spatial covariates that govern species intolerance to oil palm monoculture. Considering mammal species richness, abundance, and species composition, oil palm plantations were consistently depauperate compared to the adjacent primary forest, but responses differed between functional groups. The degree of forest habitat dependency was a leading trait, determining compositional dissimilarities across habitats. Considering both the LTC and CT data, distance from the forest-plantation interface had a significant effect on mammal assemblages within each habitat type. Approximately 87\% of all species detected within oil palm were never farther than 1300 m from the forest edge. Our study clearly reinforces the notion that conventional oil palm plantations are extremely hostile to native tropical forest biodiversity, which does not bode well given prospects for oil palm expansion in both aging and new Amazonian deforestation frontiers.},

	abstract = {Várzea forests account for 17\% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6–8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the várzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded terra firme and flooded várzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in várzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve) and a várzea forest (Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the várzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and várzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in várzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in várzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In várzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (Panthera onca) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones. Habitats that remain dry for longer periods showed more mammalian occurrence, suggesting that dispersion via soil is important even for semi-arboreal species. This is the first study to evaluate differential use of várzea habitats by terrestrial mammalian assemblages.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Colombian Orinoquia region is characterized by a high diversity of mammals, which is associated with complex ecosystems that include large extensions of Neotropical savannas (known locally as “Llanos Orientales”). Despite accelerated anthropogenic transformations in savanna ecosystems, the knowledge to design effective conservation strategies, such as the distribution of mammal assemblages, is still lacking for this region. In this paper, we evaluate if assemblages of medium and large mammals (i.e., species richness, relative abundance and the contribution of the different trophic guilds) are homogeneous across the Colombian Llanos by comparing three savanna ecosystems: floodplains savannas associated with an Andean river, aeolian floodplains savannas and highland savannas. After a sampling effort of 3,150 camera trap/days, we recorded 16 mammal species from the three savanna ecosystems. We compared the three assemblages and their constituent trophic guilds by ANOSIM and SIMPER non-parametric permutation tests. The three assemblages differed in composition, structure and trophic guilds. The floodplains savannas, associated to an Andean river, present the highest diversity, contrastingly, the high-plain associated with the Guyanese Shield presents the lowest diversity. This pattern could be explained due to the greatest floristic diversity, complex vegetation structure and more fertile soils present in the riparian forests of the floodplains savannas, despite being the most anthropogenically transformed. The carnivores were the most variable category and herbivores were the most abundant. Our results show that the diversity of medium and large mammals is heterogeneously distributed in the Colombian Llanos. Therefore, it is necessary to implement targeted conservation strategies according to the characteristics, local fragility of each ecosystem in the territory and each species response by local conditions.},

	abstract = {Piedras Blancas National Park, in southern Costa Rica, is an important component of two biological corridors connecting the Osa Peninsula (Corcovado National Park) and La Amistad International Park. Understanding the mammal community composition of Piedras Blancas will provide baseline data to evaluate the success of conservation efforts. We used camera traps and opportunistic observations to describe the medium-sized and large mammals of the park. We deployed camera traps for 1,440 trap nights (2016-2018). We detected 19 mammal species from seven orders and 13 families. Five species are globally threatened: Leopardus wiedii (Schinz, 1821), Saimiri oerstedii (Linnaeus, 1758), Ateles geoffroyi (Kuhl, 1820), Alouatta palliata (Gray, 1849), and Tapirus bairdii (Gill, 1865). We did not detect two locally threatened species, Panthera onca (Linnaeus, 1758) and Tayassu pecari (Link, 1795). Our research highlights a need for critical conservation work within the proposed biological corridor to support Costa Rica\&rsquo;s most threatened wildlife.},

	abstract = {Mammal communities in the vicinity of human settlements are often subject to subsistence hunting and retaliatory killings. We used fourteen digital camera traps equipped with infrared triggers to sample the medium-sized and large mammal communities for ca. 34 (±1.64) days per site. Diversity was measured as both Shannon entropy and Fager´s number of moves (NMS), and dominance was quantified using the Berger-Parker index. We used Kruskall-Wallis tests to investigate if there were statistically significant differences in richness, diversity and dominance among the sites. At an overall sampling effort of 1,946 trap days we recorded 216 independent observations of a total of 20 species belonging to 17 genera and 15 families. Richness and diversity appeared to be determined by forest structure, since, independent of the level of human impact, the richest areas were those closest to the ombrophilous forests of southern Guyana shield, closest to central Amazonia, whereas the poorest were at those sites closest to the vegetation mosaics of central Guyana shield. The disappearance of Tayassu pecari from the impacted areas as well as higher relative abundances in the protected areas, albeit not significant, foresees a possible bleak future for the mammalian assemblages in the near future.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are one of the most common carnivoran species in natural areas and their populations are still increasing. Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark–recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0–73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., {\textgreater}50\% of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark–recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior.},

	abstract = {In tropical forests, the diets of many frugivorous mammals overlap, yet how hyper-diverse assemblages of consumers exploit resources and coexist remains poorly understood. We evaluated competitive interactions among three species of terrestrial frugivorous mammals, the ungulate Tayassu pecari (white-lipped peccary), its close relative Pecari tajacu (collared peccary), and a large rodent (Dasyprocta azarae, agouti), in their exploitation strategies of palm resources of different quality. We conducted the study in a large isolated fragment at the tropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil, where these mammal species show high spatial and temporal overlap. We evaluated if body mass and foraging group size define a hierarchy in exploitation of preferentially richer palm resources. We used camera traps and two-species occupancy models to examine patterns of co-occurrence and variable interaction strength between these consumers and three species of palms. Our analyses supported the hypothesis of partial resource overlap but no competition among frugivores, and a body mass dominance hierarchical exploitation of resources. The larger frugivore (white-lipped peccary) dominated patches of the lipid-rich palm Euterpe edulis, where the smallest frugivore (agouti) was absent. Instead, the smallest frugivore concentrated its foraging in areas with the poorest palm resource, Syagrus oleracea. Collared peccaries preferred areas of high abundance of Syagrus romanzoffiana when the other two mammal species were rarely detected or absent, strongly avoided patches of E. edulis, and showed higher average detection probabilities when agoutis were present. Our study highlights the important role of behavioral plasticity in promoting coexistence and indicates that through context-dependent interactions and hierarchical partitioning of resources, consumers can avoid strong competition, even under conditions of high spatial and temporal overlap and high levels of habitat fragmentation and isolation.},

	abstract = {Vertebrates are a vital ecological component of Amazon forest biodiversity. Although vertebrates are a functionally important part of various ecosystem services they continue to be threatened by anthropogenic impacts throughout the Amazon. Here we use a standardized, regularly spaced arrangement of camera traps within 25km2 to provide a baseline assessment of vertebrate species diversity in a sustainable use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We examined seasonal differences in the per species encounter rates (number of photos per camera trap and number of cameras with photos). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were then used to examine the influence of five variables (altitude, canopy cover, basal area, distance to nearest river and distance to nearest large river) on the number of photos per species and on functional groups. GLMs were also used to examine the relationships between large predators [Jaguar (Panthera onca) and Puma (Puma concolor)] and their prey. A total of 649 independent photos of 25 species were obtained from 1,800 camera trap days (900 each during wet and dry seasons). Only ungulates and rodents showed significant seasonal differences in the number of photos per camera. The number of photos differed between seasons for only three species (Mazama americana, Dasyprocta leporina and Myoprocta acouchy) all of which were photographed more (3 to 10 fold increase) during the wet season. Mazama americana was the only species where a significant difference was found in occupancy, with more photos in more cameras during the wet season. For most groups and species variation in the number of photos per camera was only explained weakly by the GLMs (deviance explained ranging from 10.3 to 54.4\%). Terrestrial birds (Crax alector, Psophia crepitans and Tinamus major) and rodents (Cuniculus paca, Dasyprocta leporina and M. acouchy) were the notable exceptions, with our GLMs significantly explaining variation in the distribution of all species (deviance explained ranging from 21.0 to 54.5\%). The group and species GLMs showed some novel ecological information from this relatively pristine area. We found no association between large cats and their potential prey. We also found that rodent and bird species were more often recorded closer to streams. As hunters gain access via rivers this finding suggests that there is currently little anthropogenic impact on the species. Our findings provide a standardized baseline for comparison with other sites and with which planned management and extractive activities can be evaluated.},

In the Brazilian Cerrado biome, mammalian diversity is vast, with about 251 species, 32 of them are endemic and 22 listed as threatened species. In this work, we investigated species diversity of medium- and large-sized mammals in the private protected area RPPN Pontal do Jaburu (RPPN-PJ) and its surroundings, which is a flooded area located in an important biological corridor in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone zone, a priority area for biodiversity conservation in Brazil. We used camera-trapping, active search (night and day), and track survey during dry season (Apr – Aug 2016). We recorded 29 mammal species, being the Carnivora order the most representative with 11 species. Regarding threat status, 35.7\% of the recorded species were listed as threatened in Brazil and 32.1\% worldwide. We highlight the high relative frequency of threatened species records such as Tapirus terrestris, Panthera onca, Blastocerus dichotomus, Pteronura brasiliensis, Priodontes maximus, and other, as well as the presence of the newly described aquatic mammal species Inia araguaiaensis. We stress the importance of RPPN-PJ and its surroundings for mammal conservation, which include complex habitats (wetlands) located in an important ecotone zone.},
